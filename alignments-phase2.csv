Looks to be a problem with WorkManager.
Both started the problem after an unsuccessful attempt to send a picture or small video file.
Chat 1 It started with failed sending of picture+text to Nexus4 device.
Almost everything was tried to get it working again (lots of messages send on both devices, switching networks on and off, enable/disable disappearing messages, restarting encryption on both devices, forced stop of Signal, reboot device, update Signal to 3.31.6).
Test with receiving messages from other device successful Logs are short after problem started (19-01-13), from both devices.
I'm talking with the WorkManager devs, and apparently this may be an issue with manufacturers being too aggressive with their battery optimizations.
Now, I personally think that if the app is foregrounded, WorkManager should be running the job on it's own, independent of the JobScheduler, so I'm making that suggestion and will try to work with them to resolve this.

(Note: If the message is still stuck when you do the update, you may still have to force-stop and/or restart your device to kick it in gear.
I've run into exactly the same issue with messages not being sent to one particular contact from my mobile.
I upgraded the app to the version 4.32.8, but the messages still are not being sent to the 'problematic contact'.
Rebooting the phone or restarting Android support does not fix the problem.
So, is there any way to 'reset' the schedule and purge the stucked messages from within the Signal?
@akutuzov For SailfishOS you can go to Settings -> Apps -> Signal -> Force Stop or you stop the Android Support or restart the phone.
After that, sending was working again.
@strybe same here, all conversations that were stuck before upgrading to 4.32.8 are still stuck, whatever I do.
@akutuzov This is an Android client issue, not a server issue.
That's why you don't have any problems on desktop.
This was fixed in 4.32.8, and any stuck messages should typically be able to get 'unstuck' by restarting your phone or force-stopping signal.
I'm going to guess that SailfishOS has some bug, or otherwise undesireable  behavior, in their JobScheduler implementation.
Thanks @greyson-signal, you are doing a great work!
I suspect it should in theory be possible, since if a conversation with a contact X is stuck, I am able to create a new group chat including only me and X, and it works fine, messages are sent without any problems.
Thanks @greyson-signal  for your time and effort!
This was fixed in 4.32.8, and any stuck messages should typically be able to get 'unstuck' by restarting your phone or force-stopping signal.
I tried this and it did not solve the problem.
Maybe the behavior of this option could be expanded to also 'reset' the conversation or message queue as @akutuzov said.
The symptoms are the same: try to send a message (usually a large one, like a picture) at a moment when something is temporarily wrong with the network, like wifi reconnecting to another access point, etc.
After that this message is forever in the pending state, and it is impossible to send anything in this conversation.
At this point this issue seems to be limited to SailfishOS and rooted devices.
I don't see logs of 4.32.8 devices in #8559 that aren't rooted, but please point them out if you see them.
Maybe the behavior of this option could be expanded to also 'reset' the conversation This currently isn't a simple thing to do.
I'll re-open this issue, but I'm retitling it to be specific to SailfishOS.

First, fixing ""Issue X"" by adding the ability to force disable encryption for certain contacts directly supports the value of Freedom. Freedom, as defined in Schwartz's Taxonomy, includes components such as independence, choosing one's own goals, and privacy. By allowing users to have the freedom to choose whether to send secure or unsecure messages, the software product is empowering them to make decisions about their communication preferences, giving them a sense of independence and control. This feature respects their freedom to decide the level of security they want for their conversations, rather than imposing encryption on all communications.

Furthermore, this enhancement aligns with the value item of Self Direction within the value of Freedom. Self Direction includes elements such as autonomy, curiosity, and creativity. By providing the option to disable encryption for certain contacts, the software product allows users to express their curiosity and creativity in their communication choices. They can experiment with different levels of security based on their relationships and the content of their messages. This flexibility promotes self-direction, enabling users to tailor their communication experience to their own preferences and needs.

Overall, the addition of the ability to force disable encryption for certain contacts addresses the value of Freedom and its corresponding value item of Self Direction. This feature empowers software users to exercise their independence, make choices about their communication preferences, and express their curiosity and creativity in how they interact with the software product.

I was at Dollar Store, I found a funny product, I took a picture of it and I tried to send it with a message to a friend. The picture reaches 5% and then it's stuck. I try to send two more messages and they just refuse to send. I start to suspect my phone internet is dead, so I go outside and connect to McDonald's WiFi. Internet works flawlessly.

I and my contact are ""push registered"", but at various times one of us goes offline for a few hours and would like to seamlessly switch to SMS.
Explanation: I only use data when connected to WiFi, so SMS is prefered communication channel much of the time.  This is common amongst my contacts here in Europe, but some have mobile data.
Issue:
TS seems to switch to PUSH whenever sender has data (or even if previous conversation was PUSH). This leads to frustrating undelivered messages if sender simply hits reply without deliberately forcing SMS.

When there is evidence that the sender or recipient is offline, there should be some way to prefer SMS.
Two possible ways to avoid these undelivered PUSH replies:
Seamless SMS fallback if either person is not online.
If ""seamless"" is not an option: receiving an SMS should trigger SMS mode for the conversation.  I understand that defaulting to SMS is problematic now that SMS encryption is gone, but this could be an ""Advanced"" option for nerds like me.

For group messaging you can select ""conversation"" or ""broadcast"" mode, broadcast being functionally the same as what you're proposing. Is there any specific reason why you want to avoid MMS all together, even MMS broadcast mode? Just curious :) Well broadcast does seem to be similar to what I wanted. I didn't want the conversation mode because when people reply, it goes to everyone else. I guess I have a problem unrelated to this ticket, but MMS doesn't work for me. I can't receive or send them with TextSecure. I've got a Galaxy S4 Active running Android 4.2.2 on AT&T. I've tried putting custom APN settings, but they don't seem to work. I haven't tried to research it further, and I figured if the group message I was sending didn't have pictures or attachments, it should be SMS. I didn't realize that MMS had different modes though. Until recently I also was not aware that group messaging was a feature of MMS and not SMS. Sending MMS has become much more difficult for 3rd party text messaging apps like TextSecure because the majority of modern Android devices now forbid 3rd party apps from reading device APN settings. This means that MMS settings for each individual service provider must be hard-coded into the app itself or provided by the user.
I'm in the middle of a pull request #334 to address a couple MMS related issues (group messaging included) and also hope to provide an easier way to verify user provided APN/MMS settings. Closing under the idea that existing ""Broadcast MMS"" option is a viable alternative to literal individual SMS and literal individual SMS is something of a ""will not fix"" based on the similar direction of most SMS/MMS apps. The default Android (CM 10.1) SMS application supports this feature. I need it, because I get free SMS, but not free MMS. In addition MMS are incredibly expensive. If I am not mistaken, MMS also needs an active internet connection, which is also very expensive here. Please reopen. I agree. I re-experienced this problem yesterday. Not all of my friends'
phones receive MMS correctly, and if it's just a text message, why send an
MMS in broadcast mode? Is there a technical difference?

If one of the messages fails, you could display the regular error symbol, and in the message details provide a list of destinations that failed.
For me it is totally acceptable that the replies will not be displayed in the same conversation, but as individual messages. I really just need to send one SMS to several destinations. +1
As the app aims to be a replacement for the default sms application the basic sms features should also be working. I also agree with @devurandom that the replies could be displayed as individual messages, this is the same behaviour as in every sms application I have used before. @bennibu

When the phone did not send the MMS she tried it again, resulting a load of MMS. I guess due not being connected to the internet, the phone could not send it. When she finally connected to the net, they flushed out and flooded her friends and now her phone bill.

Hangouts don't do it no more :( Me too is missing that option - even receiving MMS is expensive in my country and it's really annoying to copy & paste every text to another contact...

26,Exp D,Exp I,Signal-Android,Messaging and Communication Issues,https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/170,"Failure to Identify Contacts Phone: Motorola Triumph
Android: 2.2.2
Provider: Virgin Mobile
This is not a serious issue but it has been bugging me for a while. TextSecure will fail to identify some of my contacts either by not displaying a picture, their name, or both.
I can not figure out why it identifies some contacts with name and picture but not others. I thought it might be because some contacts are synced from my e-mail account and some are stored locally on the phone but I tested this and the account type did not seem to matter.
However, contacts that do not show picture or name on the list view landing page will sometimes have the picture in the thread conversation view, but no name. I can't imagine that this is still a problem after nearly a year. This has been reworked several times. Can you give us feedback if it's still an issue or if it can be closed? Also android 2.2 is not supported, going to close this and @JAV4NkfV can reopen if necessary :). There was no new version for me to install on Froyo so I can't re-install
or update to see if it has been fixed. As it stands on my phone now, the
original problem of non-identification of contacts persists.
I mainly use a Nexus 7 2013 tablet for communication now, and was
disappointed that I can't get TextSecure through the Play store (is it
available for side-load somehow by chance?). The new description on the
app's Play page sounds as if TS doesn't just do sms over cellular anymore
but now uses data connections to send messages like Whatsapp does. If this
is the case then why is there no tablet version?
Hope you guys get a multi-platform version out soon, otherwise Wickr is
going to eat your lunch, when most people will still prefer an open source
option.
Thanks for checking back in with me. :)

Bug description
Signal is not able to send a text message (SMS) to a special phone number like 9990033612345678.
This is a special prefix number used by French operator Bouygues Telecom with option B.Duo.
B.Duo allow you to have a second line (virtual line) on the same sim card but you have to use prefix 999 to use the second number. When Sending a message with a prefix 999 it will actually send it with your regular number to your operator but the receiver will see the virtual number from your second line (this is also working for calls).
I don't know if this system exists in others countries, but this is very useful when you use ad service (like craiglist) and don't want to display your original number.
More info here : https://www.services.bouyguestelecom.fr/communication/b-duo
Steps to reproduce
receive a sms or send to a number like 9990033612345678

Thanks for your help, love using Signal :) Same with long special numbers in Norway. But apparently Signal prepends +47 on the incomming message but only uses 47 (with no +) when replying. The correct behaviour would be not to prepend +47/47 - relevant numbers include 05123xxxxx, 08321xxxx, and 2252xxxx
I suspect prepending the country-code to ""weirdly long"" numbers are always wrong and should only be done on ""normal"" numbers. Dedicated short numbers, for instance 2115 does not exhibit this problem.
Unfortunately I don't have a relevant debug-log available.
Signal version 3.16.0 on a Sony Xperia Z5 Compact. Can confirm this issue, special long numbers that are mostly used for automatically sent messages that required you to reply with a code for confirmation (e.g. to confirm a bid when bidding on a house or property) can not be sent to using Signal. I have the same issue with my five digit phone number of my Norwegian bank. I am not able to send a SMS to 19872 in Poland.
Signal automatically changes the number to +4819872 which result in failure to send SMS.

The user should be able to split these into multiple conversations. There's no way to distinguish which SMS messages should go into which conversation if we don't do it by contact. You can work around this by creating multiple push groups with the same contact and only have them and you as members. If two consecutive  messages are separated by more than ~3 hours, make them separate conversations (with back and forward buttons perhaps). I see no reason why messages from/to one contact should be split into several conversations. In fact that would blow up the conversations list and make it even more horrible to read.
@beojan please elaborate on what you intend to achieve by splitting conversations. As a sidenote, the stock sms application behaves exactly the same as textsecure does. I also wouldn't like this to happen.
I guess there's a misunderstanding in the term ""conversation"". Your understanding would be as in continuous talking, separated by times of not talking. Automating the separation by a time threshold is arbitrary. It often takes me 3h or any other length of time to respond to something, for various reasons, and it's still the same ""session"". Having the user separate conversations is overhead really.
Thinking about it, it could be argued, that those who want separate conversations with one contact could deliberately start a new thread, and those who don't just wouldn't. But that would either require forcing the other side to start a new thread as well (information TS would have to cram into every SMS, which already chews up 100 bytes of every message, but maybe it's worth it?) which would clutter up the other side's conversation list, or have the other side decide on starting a new conversation or keeping the old one. The first way would leave the other side with no choice on the matter, except for asking the sender explicitly to not split. The second way would mean including a pretty advanced and probably rarely used option to the option menu, in an app that's mostly about providing secure messaging with a very lean user experience.

@benmayne I didn't see anything in the log to imply a message receive failure, so it was likely that the message was not sent.
Do you think the occurrences on 10/3/2018 and 11/17/2017 were also due to safety number changes in a group? I don't know about 10/3.

Extra thought
This may not be an issue with Signal at all, but rather with Android Auto. The last word in the voice prompt to record a message is ""message"". It seems reasonable that the recording may be picking up the end of the voice prompt. Have you been seeing this in other messaging platforms as well? I agree this could very well be a bug with Android Auto since on my car I use Signal with Android Auto all the time and I have only had it prepend the full ""Whats the Message?"" prompt once on me. One of the Signal devs can correct me if I'm wrong but I believe applications working with Android Auto don't really do much more than simply receive the message after it has been converted to text by Android Auto. Have not tried other messaging apps but I can give it a shot later today.

Bug description
I was at Dollar Store, I found a funny product, I took a picture of it and I tried to send it with a message to a friend. The picture reaches 5% and then it's stuck. I try to send two more messages and they just refuse to send. I start to suspect my phone internet is dead, so I go outside and connect to McDonald's WiFi. Internet works flawlessly. I disconnect from McDonald's and I try my mobile data. Internet works flawlessly.
Now I'm at home on my WiFi and it's still not sending. I'm 99% sure a reboot of the phone will fix the issue, but this is still annoying and IMO it shouldn't happen at all.
Steps to reproduce
Send a picture
Have your mobile data temporarily die for a couple of seconds
The image gets stuck, no matter how long I wait the image never officially ""fails""
Nothing can be sent after it
Actual result: Images can get stuck indefinitely
Expected result: Images automatically fail after a certain amount of time. Or even better, an image failing to send doesn't render the entire app useless until you restart the app/phone.

By fixing this issue, users will be able to choose the messaging method that suits their needs, promoting independence in their communication choices.

Currently, when encountering a new contact who is not registered with Signal, users are presented with the option to send a Signal message by default.

Fixing this issue by allowing users to manually select their preferred messaging method when encountering a new contact would provide them with the freedom to exercise their own judgment and make independent decisions about their communication.

Furthermore, addressing this issue would improve the user experience by preventing failed attempts to send Signal messages to non-Signal users.

Is there anything at all odd about the addresses of A or B?
Do you have more than one number associated with either of them? No addresses involved. Each person has one phone number listed in their contact 'card' (and the numbers are different, just to confirm it's not an obvious mistake at my end). Sorry, by ""address"" I meant phone numbers.  They're just normally formatted, regular phone numbers? Yep, they show at the top of the conversation window in the following formats:
NameOfIntendedRecipient
01234123456
or
NameOfActualRecipient
01234 123456
So the only difference/oddity is that one has a space in the formatting whilst the other doesn't. @drewstiff have you experienced this bug again since first reporting? I stopped using the app permanently after this bug first occurred.

Bug description
If a user is blocked, they cannot actually leave the group on the blocker's phone-- the message straight up doesn't make it through. Thus, the blocked user will continue to receive all messages from the blocker(s) within the group despite leaving.
Steps to reproduce
Add a user to a group
Block the user
Blocked user leaves the group
Send messages in the group
Steps to fix the issue on a per-group basis
Unblock the user
Add them to the group again
Have them leave again
Actual result: Blocked user continues to receive messages despite being removed from the group; but only from the blocker(s)
Expected result: Blocked user should not receive messages as they have left the group.

The expectation is, If somebody really needs to contact you, they'll either call or write a text message.
So when it's working hours, the other one doesn't immediately reply to your push messages, and you have to contact them, forcing TS to send an SMS is the next best option.
No need for TS to know if they are offline (#677, #678) For cases 2-4 the message will already be sent via SMS, won't it?
But in case 1 it would be a nice option to send just one message via SMS.
For cases 2-4 the message will already be sent via SMS, won't it?
I want the same functionality as with the fallback function.
But in case 1 it would be a nice option to send just one message via SMS.
We could do that, but I don't really see the point of sending an unencrypted data message or SMS.
If there is no real use case for the existing and broken ""send unencrypted"" function, we could just replace it.
Ah ok, then I didn't really understand what you meant.
I just wanted to say that the cases 2-4 of what you want are already the default behaviour, so we only need to care for the first case.
But I also can't think of an use case where one would need this function because it would be easier to just end the secure session.
So I agree that it would make sense to replace this function with the ""send via SMS""-option.
Hi Buddies!
My humble opinion about the question proposed in this topic.
I read lots of issues and messages in the mailing list about it and related things, and I'm from the opinion that SMS channel is not a fallback: it's an alternative!
The PUSH channel has pros and contras, and the same about SMS channel.
PUSH channel is great to whose who have data connects (Wi-Fi, 3G...) available and/or free, and do not care if the destinatary just will receive the message when he connects to Internet (if he connects!).
SMS channel is great to whose who have plans in which it's cheaper to use SMS than 3G, and prioritizes the delivery speed.
Originally, you know, TextSecure was a SMS great client before to be, too, a PUSH great messenger.
So, I would like to reinforce the proposal that when both channels are available to be chosen (it means: both are TextSecure users with PUSH mode on), the choice should be given in each message to the user.
It is the user who knows his haste and urgency, and if is better to him to burn megabytes on 3G or burn a SMS.
Currently, TextSecure just offers two ways to send PUSH and SMS: to send PUSH, the sender has to be online in that moment; to send SMS, the sender has to be offline in that moment.
However, it should not be a problem to send a PUSH when the mobile is offline (every normal WhatsApp or Telegram user knows what happens: the message just will be sent when he connects to Internet and just will be delivered when the destinatary connects too), and should not be a problem to send a SMS when the mobile is online.
My 2 cents Buddies!
It never hurts to say that TextSecure is really great!
Congrats and thanks a lot for all the work!
Hugs!
In order to send him a text message (SMS), I either have to disable Textsecure as standard sms app manually or unregister from push, disable encrypted conversation with this very contact an afterwards register push again.
Such a hassle.
In these cases, I would like to have an option to either 'always force unencrypted sms' for a specific contact or another way to (a little dirty) ""phone, please forget that this user has whisperpush registered"".
To merge this issue, #1116, #1223 and #984, an implementation of a 'multi layer solution' seems desirable: global: default conversation style priority (as already implemented), maybe even extended to ""data/push encrypted"", ""data/push unencrypted"", ""sms encrypted"", ""sms unencrypted"".
So ""data/push encrypted"" and ""data/push unencrypted"" could be merged to ""data/push (always encrypted)"" user specific (long press userchat OR userchat menutab): if default/global way not desired, define user specific default (consider this in appearance of SEND-arrow) long press send: dropdown menu: choose for ONE TIME delivery: ""data/push encrypted"", ""data/push unencrypted"", ""sms encrypted"", ""sms unencrypted"".
This range of choices should / should not (I am not sure) depend on the global ""push available"", ""sms available"" menu entries already available.
Keep on your great work!
Ok, then I'll have to wait for these: #1049, #619 @Hellmy already programmed the functionality I asked for in this issue, it just has to get merged: #1116 I'm going to close this, as #1116 just got merged.",Benevolence,Helpful,"Fixing ""Issue X"" supports the value item of helpfulness in Schwartz's Taxonomy.

I find it remarkably difficult to find old contacts conversations in Signal, for three reasons:
the global search function doesn't search archived messages, for either the name of the conversation (e.g. the contact's name) or the conversation content
the global search function doesn't search current conversation content

The ability to send longer text messages promotes freedom of expression and encourages curiosity and creativity in communication. With a higher character limit, users can delve deeper into their thoughts and ideas, explore different perspectives, and engage in more meaningful and fulfilling conversations. This expansion of self-expression aligns with the essence of self-direction, as individuals can actively shape their communication and forge their own unique path in expressing themselves.

But when I enter the username and password manually, the login button works and I'm able to log in. This happens on all Social websites(Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo, Instagram etc)

Sending duplicate emails can be extremely embarrassing, especially in professional settings where individuals rely on email communication to present themselves in a competent and efficient manner. By resolving this issue, software users are able to avoid the negative consequences of duplicate emails, such as being perceived as careless or unprofessional.

The value of power, as defined in Schwartz's Taxonomy, encompasses the desire for social recognition and preserving one's public image.

The expectation is, If somebody really needs to contact you, they'll either call or write a text message.
So when it's working hours, the other one doesn't immediately reply to your push messages, and you have to contact them, forcing TS to send an SMS is the next best option.
No need for TS to know if they are offline (#677, #678) For cases 2-4 the message will already be sent via SMS, won't it?
But in case 1 it would be a nice option to send just one message via SMS.
For cases 2-4 the message will already be sent via SMS, won't it?
I want the same functionality as with the fallback function.
But in case 1 it would be a nice option to send just one message via SMS.
We could do that, but I don't really see the point of sending an unencrypted data message or SMS.
If there is no real use case for the existing and broken ""send unencrypted"" function, we could just replace it.
Ah ok, then I didn't really understand what you meant.
I just wanted to say that the cases 2-4 of what you want are already the default behaviour, so we only need to care for the first case.
But I also can't think of an use case where one would need this function because it would be easier to just end the secure session.
So I agree that it would make sense to replace this function with the ""send via SMS""-option.
Hi Buddies!
My humble opinion about the question proposed in this topic.
I read lots of issues and messages in the mailing list about it and related things, and I'm from the opinion that SMS channel is not a fallback: it's an alternative!
The PUSH channel has pros and contras, and the same about SMS channel.
PUSH channel is great to whose who have data connects (Wi-Fi, 3G...) available and/or free, and do not care if the destinatary just will receive the message when he connects to Internet (if he connects!).
SMS channel is great to whose who have plans in which it's cheaper to use SMS than 3G, and prioritizes the delivery speed.
Originally, you know, TextSecure was a SMS great client before to be, too, a PUSH great messenger.
So, I would like to reinforce the proposal that when both channels are available to be chosen (it means: both are TextSecure users with PUSH mode on), the choice should be given in each message to the user.
It is the user who knows his haste and urgency, and if is better to him to burn megabytes on 3G or burn a SMS.
Currently, TextSecure just offers two ways to send PUSH and SMS: to send PUSH, the sender has to be online in that moment; to send SMS, the sender has to be offline in that moment.
However, it should not be a problem to send a PUSH when the mobile is offline (every normal WhatsApp or Telegram user knows what happens: the message just will be sent when he connects to Internet and just will be delivered when the destinatary connects too), and should not be a problem to send a SMS when the mobile is online.
My 2 cents Buddies!
It never hurts to say that TextSecure is really great!
Congrats and thanks a lot for all the work!
Hugs!
In order to send him a text message (SMS), I either have to disable Textsecure as standard sms app manually or unregister from push, disable encrypted conversation with this very contact an afterwards register push again.
Such a hassle.
In these cases, I would like to have an option to either 'always force unencrypted sms' for a specific contact or another way to (a little dirty) ""phone, please forget that this user has whisperpush registered"".
To merge this issue, #1116, #1223 and #984, an implementation of a 'multi layer solution' seems desirable: global: default conversation style priority (as already implemented), maybe even extended to ""data/push encrypted"", ""data/push unencrypted"", ""sms encrypted"", ""sms unencrypted"".
So ""data/push encrypted"" and ""data/push unencrypted"" could be merged to ""data/push (always encrypted)"" user specific (long press userchat OR userchat menutab): if default/global way not desired, define user specific default (consider this in appearance of SEND-arrow) long press send: dropdown menu: choose for ONE TIME delivery: ""data/push encrypted"", ""data/push unencrypted"", ""sms encrypted"", ""sms unencrypted"".
This range of choices should / should not (I am not sure) depend on the global ""push available"", ""sms available"" menu entries already available.
Keep on your great work!
Ok, then I'll have to wait for these: #1049, #619 @Hellmy already programmed the functionality I asked for in this issue, it just has to get merged: #1116 I'm going to close this, as #1116 just got merged.",Universalism,Wisdom,"Fixing ""Issue X"" supports the value item of wisdom in Schwartz's Taxonomy.

The user should be able to split these into multiple conversations. There's no way to distinguish which SMS messages should go into which conversation if we don't do it by contact. You can work around this by creating multiple push groups with the same contact and only have them and you as members. If two consecutive  messages are separated by more than ~3 hours, make them separate conversations (with back and forward buttons perhaps). I see no reason why messages from/to one contact should be split into several conversations. In fact that would blow up the conversations list and make it even more horrible to read.
@beojan please elaborate on what you intend to achieve by splitting conversations. As a sidenote, the stock sms application behaves exactly the same as textsecure does. I also wouldn't like this to happen.
I guess there's a misunderstanding in the term ""conversation"". Your understanding would be as in continuous talking, separated by times of not talking. Automating the separation by a time threshold is arbitrary. It often takes me 3h or any other length of time to respond to something, for various reasons, and it's still the same ""session"". Having the user separate conversations is overhead really.
Thinking about it, it could be argued, that those who want separate conversations with one contact could deliberately start a new thread, and those who don't just wouldn't. But that would either require forcing the other side to start a new thread as well (information TS would have to cram into every SMS, which already chews up 100 bytes of every message, but maybe it's worth it?) which would clutter up the other side's conversation list, or have the other side decide on starting a new conversation or keeping the old one. The first way would leave the other side with no choice on the matter, except for asking the sender explicitly to not split.

When all SMS messages to/from a contact are shown as one conversation, it can become difficult for the user to locate and track specific messages within a lengthy conversation. This lack of organization may lead to a sense of insecurity and disorderliness for the user.

By allowing the user to split conversations into multiple threads, the user gains control and the ability to separate different topics, discussions, or contexts with a single contact. This feature provides a more organized and streamlined messaging experience. The user can easily find and revisit specific conversations without having to scroll through a long and cluttered thread. This sense of organization and orderliness contributes to the user's overall sense of security in their messaging interactions.

Additionally, the ability to split conversations based on time intervals also enhances the user's sense of security and coherence. By having separate conversations for messages that are separated by more than a specified time limit, the user can view messages in a more contextually relevant way.

But no plain text or html rendering is shown after, just nothing.
I can reproduce this every time.
Just sending MIME text/plain with encrypted text works fine.

please send a mail like this to me at look@my.amazin.horse, encrypted to my key 0xdeadfa11 so I can investigate Hi.
I continued investigating this problem and found out if you have choosen OpenKeyChain as OpenPGP App which you find under Settings --> Accountsettings --> Cryptography --> OpenPGP App than the described behavior will occur.
But if you choose None Selection than you get the pgp/mime parts as files in your message.
Should this be the right behavior?
(Note: The menu items are my translation and can be differ in the english version) And as an off-topic question: Have you plans to support the direct showing up off pure html encrypted messages in K9 itselfs when they are send as multipart/encrypted (pgp/mime) messages?
And as a second off-topic question: Why is the type of a file more important than the content itselfs?
Means if I encrypt a pure html message which is stored in .html file or is stored in a .png file and send the encrypted part in correct pgp/mime messages like above (build after the mentioned standard) it will lead to different open options in OpenKeyChain after encryption because the former file type is recognized and therefore is not recognized as pure html text?
And all that said, please where is the major difference of version 5.010 to 5.203 for users other than that I save to clicks (not have to press ""show message"" --> ""more"" )?
@oniter Did you send @Valodim an example?
As for the intended behaviour, the expectation is that the decrypted mail is rendered correctly in the e-mail app.
If you don't have an encryption provider the expectation is that the application suggests you install one, not that we provide the content as attachments.
Have you plans to support the direct showing up off pure html encrypted messages in K9 itselfs when they are send as multipart/encrypted (pgp/mime) messages?
That's the aim of the system and in most cases it works as expected, hence why Valodim wanted an example.
Why is the type of a file more important than the content itselfs?
We look at the MIME type, then the file type.
The reason is because it's a potential security vulnerability - passing unknown content to lots of different file loaders and seeing which works is asking for problems.
Guessing content from contents is a time consuming strategy that's unreliable.
MIME types exist for a reason.
Most email applications send the correct MIME type.
And all that said, please where is the major difference of version 5.010 to 5.203 for users other than that I save to clicks (not have to press ""show message"" --> ""more"" )?
Properly generated encrypted email is automatically shown inline in the app.
@philipwhiuk  Thx a lot for answering.
Now knowing what should be the normal behavoir I will send @Valodim  some examples.
Therefore the graphically proof right now: First: Mail without encryption and no multipart, just to show the right rendered content Second: With pgp provider NONE selected What shows the same result after OpenKeyChain decryption but in another application.
Third: With pgp provider OpenKeyChain selected @Valodim Today I send you the above messages (two) to look@my.amazin.horse.
One encrypted with your pub key 0xdeadfa11.
Should it be a problem with the gmx provider I can send you the sec_key and passphrase and the logins for the gmx_account.
Got your message.
The problem is that it is not well-formed: The outer mime structure of the encrypted message is fine, however to conform with rfc3156 the encrypted data must be a mime structure itself.
In your test mail, the encrypted data has no mime header, and immediately begins with <html>.
This is not correct, and there is no way for a user agent to know that the contained data is indeed html.
The simple fix is to have a line Content-Type: text/html on top of your encrypted content, followed by an empty line.
While it would be possible to add heuristics to deal with this type of malformed data (no mime header -> interpret as body, starts with <html> -> display as html), I really don't think we should, because it enables senders to be sloppy about their message formatting, adding vast complexity to the ecosystem.
We have been doing this for far too long Thx very much for investigation.
I can confirm that with that line of Content-Type it works great.
I didn't read this in the rfc specification and nor did I when searching web for how to build up multipart/encrypted messages right.
And if you have a little to-do that says what the standards are maybe with an example it would be great, specially now while K9 supports PGP/mine messages.
So sorry for the extra work and thx in general for that great mail-client.

It would be great if K9 mail would support autoconfig like proposed by Mozilla: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Thunderbird/Autoconfiguration
Basically, this works as follows: I enter fred@example.com as email address. Instead of guessing that my mail server is imap.example.com, my connection security SSL/TLS at port 993 and my username fred, K9 contacts http://autoconfig.example.com/mail/config-v1.1.xml?emailaddress=fred@example.com which returns an XML configuration file. This XML file tells K9, that the mail server is actually someotherhost.example.net, STARTTLS at port 143 is the preferred connection method and my user name is fred@example.com.
Microsoft uses similar techniques for their Exchange servers, but instead of querying autoconfig.example.com, the domain autodiscover.example.com is used. See https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/jj900169(v=exchg.150).aspx for more information. Also note SRV records for configuring incoming mail servers

Actually there are at least three ways for autoconfiguration:
Autodiscover, xml based: created by Microsoft about 12 years ago. Probably mostly for Outlook/Exchange accounts, but also works with any other email account. This site should give all information needed for implementation:

With any of these configuration mechanisms a user would only have to provide his email address and a password to get the correct configuration settings for pop3, imap and smtp (submission). As said in last comment the Microsoft stuff is very complicated, incompletely documented, differs between client versions and is not even fully supported by Microsoft tools, so I'd drop that in any consideration.
The SRV based stuff is fine, but limited in scope to Autoconfig. It can't provide username and some other details (login methods, preferred ports, ...).
Thought a fine implementation should probably try Autoconfig first and when not provided use SRV based configuration for the server names. This issue was worked on at GSOC 2017, see:

Nice app, nice work. Any news?
BTW docs seem to be here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Thunderbird/Autoconfiguration
There seem to be multiple ways that autodiscover is implemented. It would be great if this feature were finally merged into k9. Bad enough that the android own mail client does not support any of these methods! @smeinecke Last time I checked the branch that had this feature it had a lot of other changes so it was really hard to cherry-pick and the quality was not that great (but it worked! :) ).
I suppose it would take some time to get it in shape and at least support a minimal subset of autoconfig.xml. So I added some SRV records as suggested in this thread for both imaps on port 993 and submission on 587, but K9 failed to detect these DNS records - forcing a manual configuration. The DNS records were correctly verified, so not sure why K9 doesn't use these.

The discussion emphasizes the convenience and simplicity of the autoconfiguration feature proposed by Mozilla and Microsoft. By implementing this feature in K9 mail, users can easily set up their email accounts without the need for manual input of server details. This enhancement significantly improves the overall user experience and promotes enjoyment and pleasure in using the app.

Currently, users may struggle with configuring their email accounts on K9 mail, especially when using IMAP/SMTP servers other than well-known service providers like GMail. The automatic configuration process often fails, leading to frustration and inconvenience. By supporting autoconfig like proposed by Mozilla and Microsoft, K9 mail can eliminate this issue and streamline the account setup process. Users will no longer have to manually enter server details or guess the correct configurations. This added convenience greatly enhances the pleasure of using the email functionality of the app.

Furthermore, the autoconfiguration feature not only simplifies the setup process but also saves users valuable time and effort. In the discussion, it is mentioned that setting up a script to auto-create the configuration files on the server side took less than a day. This implies that implementing the feature in K9 mail would not require significant development time and resources. Users can benefit from this time-saving feature and enjoy a smoother and more efficient experience when setting up their email accounts. This aspect of efficiency and convenience aligns with the value of Hedonism, as it allows users to maximize their enjoyment of the app without unnecessary hurdles or complexities.",Agreed-Justified,Agree,,Agree,

One of the aspects of security that Schwartz's Taxonomy includes under the value of Security is a sense of belonging. When users receive updates and notifications about the app, they become more aware of the ongoing development and improvements being made. This sense of belonging allows them to feel like they are a part of the app's community, thus enhancing their overall sense of security.

Additionally, by being informed about infrastructure problems and security issues through service announcements, users understand that the developers are actively working to ensure their safety and provide a reliable app. This creates a sense of trust and security, further enhancing their sense of belonging as they feel supported and cared for by the app's developers.

Furthermore, the service announcement system allows users to have control and choice over the level of messages they want to receive. This empowerment gives software users a sense of autonomy and control over their app experience, further enhancing their overall sense of belonging. They can choose to receive notifications about specific updates or features that they are interested in, making them feel more connected to the app and its community.

@geileszeuch I don't think making the reception of those messages optional is a viable option, as it would greatly reduce the usefulness - hardly any users ever go into the advanced settings, where this option would surely be hidden away and only a miniscule percentage of users will ever activate the random sending .
This was designed with SMS in mind, where traffic data retention makes it very easy to re-create social graphs.
Weights can be adjusted slowly over time and sometimes randomly introducing new peers...) It is also important that the fake network is built not only from user's own contracts, but also from contacts' contracts' ... contacts.
I live in a EU country and my plan includes 100 outgoing texts+minutes and 200MB a month.
Doing this by default is a big no.
But we simply can't activate this feature by default for the average user, the cost for SMS in Europe is just too high.
I'd like to choose this as a default setting for highly endangered users as I explain in #838 but hide it away in the advanced settings from the W***sap people.
@ncruces I think this should be off by default for most users.
When I threw the number of 25 into the room, I was talking about instant messages, not SMS.
I have a plan with 1GB of data volume, after that it's capped to 128kbit/s but I don't get charged any more.
I pay for every SMS and minute, but I don't call or text much and at 7 cent each they aren't that expensive either.
Many people I know either have a similar plan, or a student plan with ~200-500MB data, ~200 minutes and ~200 SMS for 8-12‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚àû¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®‚àö√ú/month Yes @Lindworm, that's what I'm saying.
Some operators use 100KB, others 10KB, all do it.
I see no point in paying more, regardless of being able to afford it.
I too am in EU and pay each SMS,call, and kB individually, because i still have a very old, cheap pay-as-you-go plan.
In such a scenario the mobile communications infrastructure is very likely to be controlled and monitored by ""the enemy"".
In order to mask meaningful traffic, you would need to send a lot of fake messages.
If you don't do this then it is way too easy to check all recipients for plausibility manually.
The ""random"" contacts cannot be very random.
Finding random unknown TextSecure users that live near you (= plausible communication) is not possible because mobile numbers are not bound to locations.
Surely that random contact will be monitored as well now and he couldn't even know why.
Things are a bit different for push, but at least for SMS this should not be implemented.
The ""random"" contacts cannot be very random.
Surely that random contact will be monitored as well now and he couldn't even know why.
Things are a bit different for push, but at least for SMS this should not be implemented.
So TS users would send this information to a central server and it would be stored there for anyone to fetch?
On the contrary, just finding any other user of a ""privacy tool"" could be a ""win"" because those tools would probably be illegal to use in such a scenario.
Surely that random contact will be monitored as well now and he couldn't even know why.
I think what he wants to say is, that they don't have a choice, as with for example bittorrent (TOR uses routers and not every client is a router) the user knows (or at least should know), that other peoples activities, if surveilled, may lead to him getting in trouble.
This would mean the state wouldn't even have to suveil all phone numbers to find activists with DPI (for SMS), they just start with one activist using TS and he'll text all the others.
And they are unconnected, which means the police wouldn't even have found out about the other TS users (which probably also have something to hide) They would only have to bag them all and throw them into some dark hole.
First because they don't know about the technology, and later because they found that, even if the people aren't connected to the original suspect, they still confess to a lot of ""crimes"" when interrogated, because they assume the police found out about their political activities and is interrogating them because of those, not some random message they don't even know they even received.
I don't think that's too bad, because the information is only critical for the local authorities, who can get them the old fashioned way, but we should consider it.
When we have a significant userbase (maybe 3-5%) of all users in a country with TS installed, we could then activate this feature for the ""paranoid"" users, and tell them about it.
The jump in traffic would be obvious and police would pretty quickly be aware of this feature and that the people somebody texts often aren't connected to them in any way.
That there are now also lots of innocent people using TS won't mean the government doesn't put  them on a watch list, but the government probably doesn't have the resources to ""interrogate"" everybody.
For data we could probably turn it on without a problem, because the connection to the google push servers is encrypted and widely used.
For SMS however, we have to turn it off by default, until we have a big userbase.
So TS users would send this information to a central server and it would be stored there for anyone to fetch?
Not for everyone, just between some peers until a certain degree of distance (logical as in contact hop count and geographical as within the same or nearby buckets).
For data we could probably turn it on without a problem, because the connection to the google push servers is encrypted and widely used.
Then this feature is not critical for push messages at all, as Google's servers are considered trusted as long as the only official build is distributed trough their Play store ( #127 ).

138,Exp B,Exp J,focus-android,Feature Requests and Enhancements,https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/2792,"[Meta] Make engine choice a runtime option We want to switch from WebView to GeckoView soon. In order to roll out GeckoView gradually, while monitoring telemetry and chrashes, we want to be able to ship with both engines and decide at runtime which one to use. This will allow us to do a staged rollout and A/B test the engine.
Currently the choice of engine is a compile time option. For this to work we would have to make it a runtime option.
For that we need to:
Dissolve ""engine"" build flavor and move code into two separate packages in the main source set.
Create a single WebViewProvider instance that returns either GeckoWebView or SystemWebView at runtime.
Make sure that this decision is only made once on app start and does not change while the app is running I'm not entirely sure I'll dissolve the build flavor. I think it makes most sense to either have a default renderer or make that flavor dimension set the default renderer using a simple config setting that can later be overridden. I'd migrate all of the renderer flavor-specific code into the main project and just have default shared preferences set based on the chosen flavor. My plan is to migrate all renderer flavor-specific code as mentioned and then choose the renderer based on a shared preference. I would allow run-time switching by changing the preference and invoking ProcessPhoenix, which is ideal for this kind of systemic change to the app and its state. I'm not entirely sure I'll dissolve the build flavor.
One less flavor dimension would speed up our automated builds and get us PR feedback faster. So I'd dissolve it as soon as possible. :)
I would allow run-time switching by changing the preference and invoking ProcessPhoenix, which is ideal for this kind of systemic change to the app and its state.
Note that the engine choice is not something we want to expose to the user. Instead we'll decide what engine to use on app start based on the A/B test configuration. So I think switch at runtime (by restarting the app) won't be needed for now. @pocmo and I met this morning and reached an agreement about the best design for this feature. I'll keep the extra flavor dimension so developers can test with different default renderers easily. We may never need ProcessPhoenix for end users to switch live from A to B, but it might be useful to allow devs and QA to switch back and forth with a hidden setting.
FYI, Universal webview targets will be disappearing in the newly switchable Focus renderer versions. This is because we'll be including GeckoView in all APKs. The number of build variants will explode, so it would be wise to specify flavors when requesting builds. @colintheshots to break down. Focus

[ x] searched open and closed issues for duplicates
[ x] read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports
not following rest of template as this is a global feature request not a device specific bug report
Whatsapp has a tick system. One tick means the message has not yet been received. Two ticks means it has been received. Two blue ticks means the message was also displayed on screen (and likely read).
For obvious reasons, Signal Private Messenger does not have the blue ticks.
However, I think it should have, and it wont have to violate privacy.
I message my father on signal sometimes. But he falls asleep on the couch rather often. So when I text him that I will be at the station and need a lift at 00:24 in the night, the fact that he received the message doesn't really help me. I need to ask him to confirm he read it.
The proposed feature:
So there is a missing feature. Lets add it.
However, to preserve the privacy aware nature of Signal Private Messenger, it will have to work as follows:
A user has to manually and deliberatly turn on the confirmations. (via a slider in the settings of the conversation ""send have read confirmations"")
By default, confirmations are off.
It is not nessessary for both sides to turn on the confirmations, but only the side which did turn them on, will send them.
The sender will also see a visual cue on his own messages, reminding him he is sending out confirmations.
The other side can receive the confirmations regardless of his own setting. There is no peer pressure.
For each conversation (with a group or a person) the setting has to be toggled individually.
There is deliberatly no global setting, as we don't want new conversations to have this setting on by default. @Meteor0id please don't delete the template when opening new issues.
The read receipts are implemented since Signal v4.11.x (see cb9bc96 and Signal blog)
From Signal blog:
Our implementation of read receipts is simple. There is only one setting. Both sides must have the feature enabled in order to see each other‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢s receipts.
... They will be enabled when users install Signal, but the feature is disabled by default for existing installations.
please check if both of you have read receipts enabled, otherwise it's probably a bug and you should provide a debug log for this. @my apologies, I have missed the changelog and issue report when this feature was added. There is likely no reason to call this a bug. However, I would like to keep this ticket open as a suggestion to change the feature, on the following counts:
For each conversation (with a group or a person) the setting CAN to be toggled individually. This could be a three state slider. 1. On for this conversation, 2. inherit from global setting, 3. off for this conversation.
It is not nessessary for both sides to turn on the confirmations, but only the side which did turn them on, will send them.
The other side can receive the confirmations regardless of his own setting. There is no peer pressure.
The reason I suggest these changes is because they are more faithful to the free and open nature of Signal Private Messenger in my opinion.
The key here is having the freedom to treat my contacts in different manners, however I chose. I might want to give receipts to my girlfriend, letting her know I read the grosseries list, but I dont want to also do that with my buisness partner, who tends to continue work conversations after buisness hours.

157,Exp F,Exp J,k-9,Feature Requests and Enhancements,https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/issues/865,"Feature Request: Support Mozilla autoconfig When using K9 mail with IMAP/SMTP servers other than well known mail service providers like GMail, automatic configuration of new mail accounts will almost certainly fail.
It would be great if K9 mail would support autoconfig like proposed by Mozilla: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Thunderbird/Autoconfiguration
Basically, this works as follows: I enter fred@example.com as email address. Instead of guessing that my mail server is imap.example.com, my connection security SSL/TLS at port 993 and my username fred, K9 contacts http://autoconfig.example.com/mail/config-v1.1.xml?emailaddress=fred@example.com which returns an XML configuration file. This XML file tells K9, that the mail server is actually someotherhost.example.net, STARTTLS at port 143 is the preferred connection method and my user name is fred@example.com.
Microsoft uses similar techniques for their Exchange servers, but instead of querying autoconfig.example.com, the domain autodiscover.example.com is used. See https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/jj900169(v=exchg.150).aspx for more information. Also note SRV records for configuring incoming mail servers
DNS-based configuration: created by IETF in 2011. SRV records give
all information for email configuration. Information about this way
can be found here:¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6186
and we could use MX records to determine SMTP server addresses.
This method doesn't completely autoconfigure it - you'd still have to know the login format - email address / user-part / something else.
NB: This is: https://code.google.com/archive/p/k9mail/issues/2331 It's a pity that the code from https://github.com/dzan/k-9/tree/experimental/settings-autocomplete-finalfixes was never merged.
Did it need extra work? Any progress with this? It works like a charm for Thunderbird and others and setting up a script which auto-creates the files on server side took me less than a day with parsing the postfix and dovecot configurations for proper values for all hosted domains and usernames. A static file is much less work again.
I'd like to see my favourite Android mail programm also support that easy mechanism. Many domain providers support this already out of the box.
Its as easy as download the file (replace example.com and fred with mail address):
http://autoconfig.example.com/mail/config-v1.1.xml?emailaddress=fred@example.com
or as second try
http://example.com/.well-known/autoconfig/mail/config-v1.1.xml
and parse the resulting XML:
The XML format is really easy:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Thunderbird/Autoconfiguration/FileFormat/HowTo P.S. The Microsoft methods are complicated, partly undocumented and not even supported by all Microsoft tools (I tested several when I tried to implement usable server support and in the end gave up), so the Thunderbird method is the only useful way ATM. Actually there are at least three ways for autoconfiguration:
Autodiscover, xml based: created by Microsoft about 12 years ago. Probably mostly for Outlook/Exchange accounts, but also works with any other email account. This site should give all information needed for implementation:
Autoconfig, xml based: created by the Mozilla foundation. Quite simple xml configuration information originally created for Thunderbird, in the meantime also being used by other clients.
DNS-based configuration: created by IETF in 2011. SRV records give all information for email configuration.
With any of these configuration mechanisms a user would only have to provide his email address and a password to get the correct configuration settings for pop3, imap and smtp (submission). As said in last comment the Microsoft stuff is very complicated, incompletely documented, differs between client versions and is not even fully supported by Microsoft tools, so I'd drop that in any consideration.
The SRV based stuff is fine, but limited in scope to Autoconfig. It can't provide username and some other details (login methods, preferred ports, ...).
Thought a fine implementation should probably try Autoconfig first and when not provided use SRV based configuration for the server names. This issue was worked on at GSOC 2017, see:

Bad enough that the android own mail client does not support any of these methods! @smeinecke Last time I checked the branch that had this feature it had a lot of other changes so it was really hard to cherry-pick and the quality was not that great (but it worked! :) ).
I suppose it would take some time to get it in shape and at least support a minimal subset of autoconfig.xml. So I added some SRV records as suggested in this thread for both imaps on port 993 and submission on 587, but K9 failed to detect these DNS records - forcing a manual configuration.

i do not use twitter, but am subscribed to https://whispersystems.org/blog/ with a feed reader on laptop/phone. a no-frills notification service would be awesome. I think this is already going to be implemented with the new and planned way to distribute TextSecure out of play. Moxie talks about annoying the hell out of users until they upgrade here: #127 ;-) Thanks for pointing that out @Lindworm
imho having an alternative distribution channel is the harder task. But it does not necessarily lead to a general notification service at google play and future distribution channels.
I don't think the mentioned notification types need to be delivered by push, they can be polled (automatically once per day + manual on connection loss) from a trusted CDN. Perhaps Github Pages is an option (e.g. GET xy/android/all.json) which requires no additional external service provider or building new server software. Plus it keeps the benefits of git. A less annoying way to inform would be to just create a contact called something like ""TS-notifications"" who displays the wanted information in conversation style. GitHub Issue Cleanup:

190,Exp C,Exp H,focus-android,Feature Requests and Enhancements,https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/2792,"[Meta] Make engine choice a runtime option We want to switch from WebView to GeckoView soon. In order to roll out GeckoView gradually, while monitoring telemetry and chrashes, we want to be able to ship with both engines and decide at runtime which one to use. This will allow us to do a staged rollout and A/B test the engine.
Currently the choice of engine is a compile time option. For this to work we would have to make it a runtime option.
For that we need to:
Dissolve ""engine"" build flavor and move code into two separate packages in the main source set.
Create a single WebViewProvider instance that returns either GeckoWebView or SystemWebView at runtime.
Make sure that this decision is only made once on app start and does not change while the app is running I'm not entirely sure I'll dissolve the build flavor. I think it makes most sense to either have a default renderer or make that flavor dimension set the default renderer using a simple config setting that can later be overridden. I'd migrate all of the renderer flavor-specific code into the main project and just have default shared preferences set based on the chosen flavor. My plan is to migrate all renderer flavor-specific code as mentioned and then choose the renderer based on a shared preference. I would allow run-time switching by changing the preference and invoking ProcessPhoenix, which is ideal for this kind of systemic change to the app and its state. I'm not entirely sure I'll dissolve the build flavor.
One less flavor dimension would speed up our automated builds and get us PR feedback faster. So I'd dissolve it as soon as possible. :)
I would allow run-time switching by changing the preference and invoking ProcessPhoenix, which is ideal for this kind of systemic change to the app and its state.
Note that the engine choice is not something we want to expose to the user. Instead we'll decide what engine to use on app start based on the A/B test configuration. So I think switch at runtime (by restarting the app) won't be needed for now. @pocmo and I met this morning and reached an agreement about the best design for this feature. I'll keep the extra flavor dimension so developers can test with different default renderers easily. We may never need ProcessPhoenix for end users to switch live from A to B, but it might be useful to allow devs and QA to switch back and forth with a hidden setting.
FYI, Universal webview targets will be disappearing in the newly switchable Focus renderer versions. This is because we'll be including GeckoView in all APKs.

When viewing these messages, k9 usually shows the wrong image for at least one of them.
I suspect that FileHelper.createUniqueFile is subject to a race condition when downloading messages and needs a mutex - I'm running on the quad-core Galaxy Note 2. Specifically, multiple copies of SaveAttachmentAsyncTask can be executing at once, and I don't see any critical section / mutex code preventing them executing concurrently.
Checking if (!file.exists()), then writing the file means that two threads can both return the same filepath. Much of the code related to viewing attachments and saving attachments to external storage has been changed recently. What K-9 Mail version are you using exactly? 5.0002 What exactly are you seeing?
Does the attachment box show the wrong thumbnail?
Do you see the wrong image when you click ""Open""?
Do you click ""Save"" and then the wrong image is opened?
5.002 doesn't actually save a copy of the attachment when you click ""Open"".
Only when you click ""Save"" a copy of the attachment is written to external storage. But I believe the code in version 5.002 doesn't allow you to save two files simultaneously (even then, you'd have to click faster than the code can run). So a race condition in FileHelper.createUniqueFile() is probably not the cause of your problem.
Also, I can't find SaveAttachmentAsyncTask anywhere in the code base. It's in src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/ui/messageview/AttachmentController.java https://gist.github.com/DanielHeath/10059376d6d7f6e215c5 has the two messages I'm seeing this on currently.
The inline attachments display the wrong full-size image. Like I said, a lot has changed with that code. For version 5.002 check out the respective tag or the 5.0-MAINT branch.
That being said, displaying inline images is a completely different thing. The relevant code is in LocalStore. There cid: URIs get replaced with content provider URIs. Has there been a play store release since 5.004? No. See Releases and FAQ entry on version numbers. Want me to try 5.105 and see if I can still reproduce? Regardless, FileHelper.createUniqueFile() looks a lot like it suffers from a race condition in general.
Even if it's not the cause of the issue I'm seeing, using it anywhere which could pass the same argument twice from different threads is a bug waiting to happen. We'd love a pull request for the issue in FileHelper.createUniqueFile().
I can't reproduce the issue with the inline images. The cid URI gets correctly replaced with a content URI pointing to the correct attachment. Maybe it's a WebView caching issue.
Feel free to try 5.105, but it does not contain the current code to display inline images. We're in the process of restructuring large parts of the code base to enable PGP/MIME support. Currently master is too unstable to create an alpha/development release. Hilariously, in the 5.0-MAINT branch it's already synchronized, so someone has removed it.

Can you try updating to the beta, which has a fix for this issue, and let me know if it improves? Ich have no googleplay. If you can provide me with an apk i would try.
At some point there is a file in the backup folder. But trying to restore it ends in crashing the App on the pixel 3. I can provide you withlogs from pixel 3

This is not good. My Nexus 6P has a battery that only last like 45 min. I'm forced to stay on that phone as long as I can't backup. Sad Maybe there is a solution. @greyson-signal has to approve it first.
Greyson. Is it possbile to downgrade the official Website build, wich are all still available on the Signal Website so we can do a working backup? I assume if there wasn't any Major changes to the database. there shouldn't be a Problem. @dorakas I'm fairly confident that your specific backup issue has something to do with the fact that multiple backups are running simultaneously, which would be fixed in the beta. I can't downgrade the existing website release, but I can send you an APK of the latest beta. If you're interested, you can either message me on the forum, or send a message to one of my test numbers (+1 610 549-1426) and I'll get it to you.
@alurasg I can't say if you're having the same problem without a debug log. Please post one :) Thanks! Hi, many thanks for your reply!
Please find my debug log here.
Again, I already installed the beta, but the issue remains the same.
I've already sent an email to support@signal.org, and also submitted an
issue via their website (more than a month ago) but up until now, I
didn't receive any response.
This was the explanation of my issue:
""My question regards the Android app Signal 4.29.6.
Until a while ago, there was an option to backup via an export to xml.
This worked perfectly fine for me.
However, this option has disappeared now, and instead, there is an
option to backup and restore, but unfortunately, this option doesn't
work. At first, I thought that I had unsufficient space on my phone, but
now I cleaned up more than 1,5 GB (deleted all the pictures/movies from
the attachments) and still it doesn't work. When I put the option on, it
seems to start, I see the count of how many messages are being backed
up, but after a while, it just stops, and the option for the backup is
still on, but the last backup says 'never'. If I put the back-up off and
on again, I can try again, but same story.
Would you please be so kind as to help me?""

No problem with gmail account. I just signed onto GitHub to report this same issue, but it happens regardless of email account (gmail also). When using IMAP on any of my accounts, if I compose a draft in K9Mail, it gets deleted upon server synchronization. Initially I thought it had to do with encryption. The default setting is encrypt if possible, and if left on this setting or with ""encrypt"" selected, the draft would by deleted (with or without a recipient). By selecting ""no encryption"", the draft would be saved. However, I just recently came back to a draft i had started in K9 where I explicitly selected ""no encryption"", and it had been deleted.

(C) blocked hosts
(I recommend reading the ""blacklist"" section of https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/wiki/Content-blocking for a bit more background.)
We already read the owner names in B, although we discard the domain name for that owner:
(Note: the comment is wrong, we only skip the owners domain, but the owner name is stored in siteOwner...)

Line 106
in
fb285e0
public void put(final String url, final String siteOwner) {
Blocked hosts are stored in a Trie. A given Trie node currently stores a list of child nodes and a boolean to indicate whether that node represents a domain. We already extend Trie in WhiteListTrie in order to additionally store a whitelist (i.e. a specific domain points to a list of whitelisted domains) per node, we could similarly extend Trie (e.g. ""BlocklistTrie"") in order to store an owner/domain for each node in the blacklist. Then we can modify TrieCallback.put() to store the owner in our new BlocklistTrie, instead of discarding it.
(Our Trie implementation, including WhiteListTrie, lives at https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/blob/fb285e0b0749dc9a575e323e07a13b3e3262ab96/app/src/webkit/java/org/mozilla/focus/webkit/matcher/Trie.java )
Once the owner is stored, we can read it again when searching for blocked domains in UrlMatcher. Currently we just check that findNode() returns !null to determine whether a site is blocked. Instead we could also read the owner name (and url if appropriate) from that node:

Iam facing exactly the same issue. My data traffic has increased dramatically some weeks ago.

Family Security (v6) is a value item in Schwartz's Taxonomy that represents the importance of maintaining a sense of safety and protection for one's family. 

By fixing the issue and ensuring that attachment sizes remain consistent, software users can have greater confidence that their family-related content has not been tampered with or compromised during transmission.

225,Exp A,Exp J,focus-android,Data Handling and Storage Challenges,https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/1633,"Renumber telemetry timestamps so sessions can be split up (for Redash) When querying from the events table (telemetry_focus_event_parquet), I'm seeing about 6% of the pings returning sequences of events where the timestamps are not monotonically increasing. It is common that there will be a foreground event half way through, and the time stamp restarts at 0. I'm not sure how much of this is expected behavior.
Here is a query with some example pings. The current implementation does:
Use the ""time since boot"" to calculate the timestamps of events.
We use the timestamp of the first event as baseline and the following events' timestamps are relative to the first event.
For various reasons it can happen that we cannot write the actual ping to disk before the process dies (e.g. app crash, app killed manually, ..). The next time the app starts we'd continue with a new series of events (starting at 0). When writing the ping to disk (in order to send it) we would write all events into it (also the ones from the previous run).
It's not directly a bug - but caused by the way this is implemented. What is your requirement for analyzing the pings? We can change that behavior.
Some ideas:
Always use ""time since boot"" and don't do any ""normalization"". With that a process restart wouldn't create a new sequence but continue to previous one (maybe with large gap at times). We might see the same behavior as above for hard reboots (device runs out of battery).
On next app start send ping for already gathered events so that they do not get mixed with the events we are collecting next. @pocmo: What is your requirement for analyzing the pings?
My interest now is in looking at issues/events that happen within a session.
If I have a ping where the timestamps look like [0, 2, 4, 0, 1, 5], it sounds like (from your third point) I should be splitting it up into two sessions, with timestamps [0, 2, 4] & [0, 1, 5].

Am I understanding you correctly?
Yes, for our current definition of ""session"" this would be two sessions in one ping. @wcbeard just checking in since it's been about a month since the last updates on this bug and we're reaching the end of this sprint. How do the session timestamps look with this context? Would you prefer the other options mentioned earlier, or is this ordering of timestamps separated by session fine? We talked about this briefly on Slack some time ago:
I wonder if we need to do a change in our telemetry library here? -> #1633
hmm‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´¬¨¬®‚Äö√†√áI would like that, but since I pull a lot of the stuff into python I think I‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢m able to manually split them on my own
but for redash users, it would probably more convenient to have the pings already split up in the data set
It could be tricky figuring out how to renumber the sequences, though
I guess I feel I‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢m not familiar enough w/ the telemetry to know how much engineering effort it would require vs the improvements in information, to be able to give a strong recommendation
Probably something we could do in the future but maybe not a P2 anymore. Removing the milestone and priority to surface in triage and updating the title to reflect the new issue. Mentioning @bbinto here in case she has feedback that this should still stay in the milestone!
The context for setting priority (mainly for our redash consumers; Q: who is that), what is the priority for updating our telemetry timestamps so when sessions are combined into a single telemetry report/ping they can easily be split up? I think we should ask @wcbeard why/how he'd use the updated data Sorry all, just saw the updates
@bbinto:
why/how he'd use the updated data
Current things I‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢ve been working on have involved looking at what happens in the 1st or 2nd session, where these are defined by seq == 1 or seq == 2. In this case, the bug could lead to inflated statistics for what happens (I.e., a foreground event could be double counted if we‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢re combining 2 sessions into a single session-ping).
Another analysis I could see would be looking at how early a user discovers a feature, and how soon do we see this event. In this case, the bug could similarly make it look like features are used sooner than they actually are.
@liuche:
Would you prefer the other options mentioned earlier, or is this ordering of timestamps separated by session fine?
Either of the options mentioned above sounds good, but I like the 2nd a bit better since it keeps the normalization.

Let me further clarify why fixing ""Issue X"" directly supports the value item of Protecting the Environment and its corresponding value of Universalism from a ""Software User"" perspective.

By allowing users to import SMS messages from companies, the software product promotes the value of protecting the environment in a few ways. First, it reduces the need for paper-based communication. Instead of receiving physical mail or paper notifications from companies, users can opt to receive electronic notifications through SMS. This reduces paper waste and contributes to a more sustainable approach to communication.

Furthermore, enabling the import of SMS messages from eco-friendly organizations allows users to stay informed about environmentally conscious initiatives. Users can receive notifications and updates from organizations that support protecting the environment, such as eco-friendly product brands, conservation groups, or environmental activists.

I would like to keep copies (archive) certain mail messages on my phone.
This seems impossible at the moment when using a POP protocol to connect to a remote account.
It would be nice to be able to add a local folder to the list of folders (i.e. residing on the device/client only) and to be able to archive/save a copy of an email message for future record. If there is no taker I would like to work on this task and I have just started today!
If you agree, then please assign it to me. It might be a slow progress at start :)
My main motivation for having this feature added is because I use K-9 on my phone as a secondary email client on both POP and IMAP accounts. Since I don't want to keep all my mails on the phone, I have regular cleanups, but I would like to have a local store for important emails. I can definitely see a personal use caae for this. I am getting close to issue a pull request and this feature is 90%complete: The only sub-feature left is to move/copy messages into these new type of folders.
However, before I complete this issue, I have a semantic problem: these new type of LocalFolder objects are called Local and basically are LocalFolder objects that don't synch and with a special FolderClass in order to be identified.
K-9 class LocalFolder instead is either a mirror folder of a remote folder or a system folder (e.g. outbox).
In my implementation, when the user creates one of these new folders, he/she is asked to ""create a local folder"" and similar actions with the word local (create, delete, settings).
I do think that local is the best description of their nature, but, for clarity sake, should I replace all this new meaning of local with something else?
Possible alternatives (only for display, internally still LocalFolder objects with FolderClass = LOCAL):
Archive Folder (but it might clash with the archive action, which is something else)
Offline Folder (not very clear or catchy)
OnlyLocal Folder (ugly)
Lonely Folder (funny)
Solitary Folder :(
Local Folder (unfortunately the one I like :)
????
To be noted that the world local is not yet used in the UI so there is no confusion there.
It is mostly a replace operation in my semantic, but I am anticipating this possible question. ""Local folder"" is right for the UI IMO. FolderClass should be LOCAL_ONLY to make the distinction clear. FolderClass for the others should maybe be REMOTE_MIRROR/REMOTE_COPY
If this is close to a PR but needs re-basing or has a small list of things undone, then please push and reference the branch anyway :) If it's at PR stage.. woohoo! Hi,
the local folder implementation was completed last summer and has been working fine on my device since. There was a PR #725 at the time, but it was closed by cketti because it was considered a big change and a code refactoring was probably needed first...
My work is still on a fork under my nickname, so you can find it there if you like.
It was a big contribution so it would certainly need a merge of sort if brought back to life.
Of course I would be happy to help, but I can't commit time and effort if it ends up in nothing like in the past... Ok I'll take a look at the fork :) Hi
I am wondering if there is any update on this -- maybe in a forthcoming release, etc.?  I would really like this feature!

Some contacts do not show in Signal (like they do in other messaging apps, or in the Contacts app).
The missing contacts are seemingly random and are not Signal contacts - just standard contacts with a phone number to message via SMS/MMS.
If you search for these contacts in Signal, they are not found.
If you start a message and just type in their number manually, then send the message, they show up in the conversations list as their name (as in, the app matches their number to a name, proving that it does have Contacts permissions.
Refreshing the contacts list in Signal does nothing to fix this.
Uninstalling/reinstalling Signal does nothing to fix this.

In your phone contacts app, find the display settings.
You should have the option to show all contacts as well as contacts from different accounts (phone, Google, Signal, etc.).
Try the different selections and see if there is one (other than Signal) that seems to make sense with what you are seeing from Signal.
I wonder if the problem is related to the syncing of your contacts between the various accounts.
All of my contacts are stored on the same Google account.
I've already verified that.
I've also deleted the contacts I've had this happen with and re-added them (which didn't make a difference).
If I create test contacts and then sync contacts, the test contacts show up but the problematic ones still don't.

Update: I've managed to get one of the missing contacts to appear in Signal by un-merging that contact's entries.
Even though the primary entry had the same phone number directly on it as the merged entries, until I un-merged then to leave only the primary entry, the contact would not show up in Signal.
Even after un-merging, there was a delay.
I had told Signal to refresh Contacts manually, which it appeared to do, but the contact was still missing.
I will test more of my contacts that have merged entries to see if that is truly the problem (that Signal doesn't like merged contact entries, where other programs have no problem reading them).
Update 2: I have other contacts with exactly the same configuration as the problematic contacts before un-merging them, and they show up in Signal without any modifications.
I ran into this issue as well.
The missing contacts seem to be random.
They are all saved under Google account.
Version: 4.39.4 Seems like there's a known fix for the issue but it was never fully implemented: #7394 (comment).
Still an issue for me as well.
Solution is mentioned here: #4338 (comment) @nekromoff That may have been a workaround to that particular person's issue but that is not a true solution.
That was posted 3+ years ago and it still occurs to users, which is pretty sad considering that the ability to see contacts in order to send them messages us literally THE primary function of this (or any) messaging app.
Could not make signal have the same list of contacts as my phone and my Google Account.
Tried different things advised here and in other places on the net - nothing worked.
At the end stopped using signal.
Impacted by this issue as well, just as described in the issue, manually you can SMS message the contact and it shows up in search in the Singal app but the contact itself does not - I stopped using Signal for SMS.
Same problem here.
Have tried deleting account and resyncing to no avail.
Very annoying!
Same issue here.
Thanks to kjongsma for the pointer re using a Contacts app, but this is a bit of a  crappifying bug.
I too have this issue, and I've had it ever since i started using Signal a year ago.
I've beeen getting by using kjongsma's workaround.
I am now contemplating using signal only for Signal contacts, and reverting to standard sms app.
Seeing as how this issue has continued for literal years with no one seemingly giving any f..ks.
Some advice though: instead of just having basic ongoing bugs causing users to finally give up, you guys should just release an update that completely breaks the app.
It'll be a more efficient way of losing users rather than this policy of just not caring enough to fix basic problems.
@veritasnon I feel your frustration and I have to say that was the funniest comment I've read in a while.
Same issue.
New contacts I add seem to be available to signal, just not most of the existing contacts.
In contacts app I added a 1+ (country code) to a number that was not syncing and now it does.
Most of my contacts do not have a country code.

Curiosity is about the desire to seek out new experiences and information, and by resolving the problem of missing contacts, users are able to discover and connect with people they previously couldn't. This promotes a sense of independence and freedom in choosing who to communicate with and broadens their social interactions.

When contacts are missing, users may feel limited in their ability to reach out to certain individuals, which can hinder their curiosity and desire for new connections. By fixing this issue, Signal empowers users to fully explore and engage with their personal and professional networks, satisfying their curiosity to connect with a diverse range of individuals.

Additionally, resolving the missing contacts problem contributes to the value of self-direction. Self-direction involves individuals making choices based on their own internal values and goals. By providing a comprehensive and accurate contacts list, Signal allows users to take control of their communication preferences and decisions. They can independently decide who to contact, explore various avenues of connection, and pursue their own personal and professional interests. This enhances their sense of autonomy and aligns with the value of self-direction.

In summary, fixing the issue of missing contacts in Signal directly supports the values of curiosity and self-direction for software users.

241,Exp F,Exp K,k-9,Data Handling and Storage Challenges,https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/issues/2110,"For an email app it's quite useful to have, but not essential.
Since nowadays ""external storage"" really is on internal storage anyway, I think we can get rid of that ""feature"", too.
For me, the UX problem with permissions (in general) is that it's hard to make clear why the permission is requested and the consequences.
For contacts, I agree that technically one could use K-9 without contacts access, but that seems like a fringe case even to me, because email contents seem more likely to be sensitive than contacts, and if one doesn't trust K-9 to behave, there's no hope.
But, I could see presenting a screen that says ""K-9 is about to request access to contacts, which will be used to let you choose who to mail to and [other].
If you do not permit access to contacts, K-9 will still work, but you will have to type all email addresses exactly, with no autocompletion"".
I'm not 100% clear on storage, but one thing K-9 does that I think is important to retain is to export settings to external storage.
(I realize ""external"" is often internal, but to me the point is that this storage can be read by other apps so you can copy files off easily, e.g. using syncthing to sync the entire external storage to a regular computer.)
But, it seems fine to defer asking for permission to do that until it is needed.
Exporting settings using the storage access framework (SAF) will allow you to select the destination.
I'm all in favour of improving use of storage.
But if we have to perfect our use of storage in order to update the targetSdkVersion (which we have to do to solve Doze) then that feels very broken to me.
The commits I have make the app not crash with runtime permissions set.
I figure we make the app ask for contact permissions on upgrade and then we open an issue up to make better use of the storage architecture.
But, I could see presenting a screen that says ""K-9 is about to request access to contacts, which will be used to let you choose who to mail to and [other].
If you do not permit access to contacts, K-9 will still work, but you will have to type all email addresses exactly, with no autocompletion"".
I'm much more in favour of incremental improvements that make the app better each time and can lead to rapid user feedback than massive sweeping changes that take ages to get released and then still have to be iterated on anyway following user feedback.
I think that Contacts is something that should be asked upon first opening of the app (either after installation or upgrade).

Is there a reason we can't have runtime permissions even while targetting api level < 23?
Runtime permissions can't be used without targetSdkVersion=23 or higher.
I'm refering to this comment in the docs: Note: Beginning with Android 6.0 (API level 23), users can revoke permissions from any app at any time, even if the app targets a lower API level.
You should test your app to verify that it behaves properly when it's missing a needed permission, regardless of what API level your app targets.
which sounds like we can check permissions even with lower sdk, we just don't have to?
Please mind that ""runtime permission management"" (the ability for users to retract permissions granted upon installation of an app) is also relevant for API levels < 26: While ""stock"" Android exposes this feature since Android 8 (IIRC), it has been offered in CyanogenMod / LineageOS since long ago (IIRC since API level 20) and (WRT contacts) in AlienDalvik (API levels < 20; as @cketti and I discovered while analysing issue #3498).
It's just you can pay attention your app does not crash when a permission is not there, which you might expect, but I guess that works.
Ack.

Wait, you mean it‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢s easier to remember in which folder to go than which identity to use? (After #942, identity=key)
Yes, I have several jobs and different PGP keys for each one.
Do you mean several PGP keys for the same identity? If not I still don‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢t see how this is an issue, I also have several PGP keys for different identities, and #942 solves the case where different identities are related to the same IMAP/POP. @ache @Valodim want to keep #942 for PGP keys per identity, anything folder related should then be here. You can rename this one to ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†¬¥Add support for per folder identity/PGP key‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂≈ì√Ñ and reopen it if you want, but it‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢s likely to be closed again because only #942 will probably be supported. If you want this, the right solution is likely an issue called 'Auto-select identity based on current folder'. But it's likely to be very low priority I'd have thought given that it isn't a common workflow. @ArchangeGabriel
Wait, you mean it‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢s easier to remember in which folder to go than which identity to use?
Yes, I use descriptive folder names.
Do you mean several PGP keys for the same identity?
No, the same mailbox (Gmail), but different addresses inside it (they can be added in the web Gmail UI) and different PGP keys for them.
You can rename this one to ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†¬¥Add support for per folder identity/PGP key‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂≈ì√Ñ and reopen it if you want, but it‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢s likely to be closed again because only #942 will probably be supported.
I fully support per-email key choosing, but prefer general, much flexible approach, not only per-email but per-folder too. OK, I can see a point of folder names being more descriptive than email addresses. But that‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢s still a very corner-case usage IMHO. Anyway, once #942 landed @philipwhiuk is right that this comes down to selecting the identity depending on the folder (and regarding PGP defaults w.r.t. encrypting/signing, setting it per identity should do it too). @ArchangeGabriel
I am glad we come to terms.
and reopen it
I can't change Closed label(( is there ANY traction yet on giving users a way to send/sign  email using different private PGP keys?  i have 7 sender identities, some are personal and some are business.
i should not be using my personal PGP key to sign email that is going out via my professional email address (which is a sender identity)
the old way was FAR superior... there was a ""cryptography"" setting for each the sender identity in the list.  now that's gone for reasons no one can really defend.  :-( I sort incoming mail to multiple addresses into folders on my server, and having compose & reply auto-select an identity on a per-folder basis* would solve my biggest pain point with this app. I have been badly burned more than once by composing / replying to emails with the wrong identity because K9 silently puts a default in which does not correspond to how it works in my webmail (and in the past, in thunderbird).
BTW, I don't use PGP integration, so I'm not entirely sure I'm correct, but it looks like in one comment upthread, it was suggested that PGP discussion belonged in #942 and that this issue is purely for identities. If that's the case, let's keep PGP discussion from muddying the waters here for the large number of users who don't use it.
(I envision the reply function perhaps falling back to setting identity based on folder if a more ""trustworthy"" rule can't be applied - e.g. select identity based on the to: field of the message being replied to, but if that doesn't work, fall back to selecting based on folder if set).",Self Direction,Freedom,"Fixing ""Issue X"" enables users to automatically select a PGP key based on the current folder they are in.

Additionally, all of my contacts (after exchanging several messages) are shown as phone numbers only.
There is no contact info added based on my Android contacts.
Signal only shows additional info if a contact added name and picture directly in their Signal app.
""Refresh"" (by pressing either refresh or gesture) has no effect (rotating arrow is shown for about two seconds) Deleting Signal from Accounts in Android preferences has no effect (it is removed, can't be readded) Reinstalling Signal has no effect (there are still no contacts) Deleting all of my contacts on the device and readding them has no effect (Signal still doesn't recognize them) Restarting the device and/or Signal or deleting Signal's app data/cache has also no effect Deleting storage and cache of Android's contact storage (com.android.providers.contacts) has no effect (after synchronizing contacts in Android again, I open Signal and it still does not recognize my contacts) Creating several contacts only on the device (without synchronization) has also no effect since Signal doesn't show these contacts, too In chats, I can select ""Add to contacts"" (although this contact is already stored on the device).
After that I can add the contact to my Android contacts and it shows that the contact information has been added.
When I return to Signal, ""Add to contacts"" is still shown and I can repeat this process forever.
It seems that Signal can't access my contacts, however, Signal Desktop which is synchronized using this device recognizes my contact list and shows the expected names and photos of my contacts (only in Signal Desktop).
Signal Desktop also immediately updates my contacts when I refresh them on my device.
Signal (on Android) does show all of my contacts when I set Signal as my default SMS app.
Then Signal shows names and phone numbers, but after selecting an entry the name disappears and only the phone number is shown.

Edit 2: Bug is still present in Signal 4.18.3.
I am having the same issue with a Samsung S5, a lineage os and the new signal version.
Signal does show all contacts, when i allow it to be the standard sms app, but then it won't import all my sms conversations.
I do not want to use signal for sms, because I am using another app that encrypts sms and i use it to chat with people that are not using signal.
If I want to add a signal account in the android account settings, nothing happens but instead the screen is frozen.
I'm also running lineageOS.
I'm having a similar problem on a new Pixel 2.
Contacts appear when searching by name, but none of my conversation threads have contact names listed, they are all bare phone numbers.
None of these have fixed the issue.
I have a debug log taken right after install and sync if that'd be useful.
In my case I assumed it was bad writes to storage, but maybe there's a bug in Signal.
Like @Konsumopfer reports, what I saw was when I tried to do anything with a Signal account in android settings->accounts, it would hang.
My guess was that Signal was trying to use the account, but the de db was returning that it didn't exist, so then it would try to create it, but fail because the account already exists in the ce db.
The way I worked around it was deleting the Signal entry from /data/system_ce/0/accounts_ce.db every time I restarted my phone (again, I just assumed the storage was bad X] ), which would let the account creation succeed.
If you have those and know a bit of sql, just load up the databases in sqlite3 and remove the Signal account from the one that has it (I don't remember the layout off the top of my head, if you need help with the sql query I can look it up and write it for you).
If this really is a bug in Signal though, it should be fixed.
I don't use that phone any more, but if the devs want me to I could probably figure out a way to install Signal on it again and investigate more.
Hey @jtracey, thanks for the tip.
I temporarily fixed the issue on LOS 14.1 (nightly from Apr 18, 2018) by completing the following steps: Go to phone settings, activate developer mode, enable USB debugging, enable root via adb Connect your phone with your PC On your PC type: $ adb root, then $ adb shell.
The terminal switches to your phone's shell.
The next line begins with sqlite>.
Type DELETE FROM accounts WHERE name = ""Signal""; Disconnect from your phone, disable developer mode, open Signal, press the ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√Ü‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√®‚âà√≠¬¨¬© (bottom right) and refresh.
If you don't know the structure of the table, you can use PRAGMA table_info(accounts); and SELECT * FROM accounts; to see if there is an entry for Signal.
Actually, there was a similar issue in Nextcloud (nextcloud/android#1531).
You have to repeat the process after every restart.
Fine!
Looks like this is another bug in LineageOS, and I don't see any action we can take.
I'd recommend filing a bug with the LineageOS folks.
Solution is to first make sure no orphaned account entry exists in accounts_ce.db and to then move the app to internal storage.
Looks like this is another bug in LineageOS, and I don't see any action we can take.
Well at least it would be possible to inform the user that there was a problem, especially if the contact sync was triggered manually.

Social recognition is about gaining acknowledgement and respect from others, and in the context of software, it can be achieved by providing users with the ability to easily distinguish and differentiate their files from others. By ensuring that downloaded files are saved with a unique name (e.g.; filename (1).png), users can maintain their individual identity and ownership of files, which enhances their sense of recognition and importance within a collaborative or social environment.

When multiple users download files with the same name, it can lead to confusion and potential loss of recognition for the person who initially uploaded or created the file. By automatically appending a unique identifier to the filename, users can easily identify their own files and distinguish them from those of others. This not only prevents the overwriting of important information but also promotes a sense of ownership and recognition for the original creator.

Furthermore, when users share and collaborate on files, having unique filenames ensures that their contributions are accurately attributed and acknowledged. It allows others to recognize the specific version or iteration of a file that a user has worked on, giving credit where it is due and fostering a sense of recognition for individual contributions. This can be particularly important in team collaborations or shared document environments where proper recognition and attribution are essential for maintaining trust and valuing individual efforts.

By increasing the minimum SDK version, the software product becomes compatible with a wider range of devices. This allows users to choose their preferred device for accessing the software, giving them the independence to select a device that best suits their needs and preferences.

Firstly, by expanding device compatibility, fixing the issue empowers users to access the software on various devices, including older devices that may not be compatible with higher SDK versions. This flexibility promotes independence by allowing users to choose a device based on factors such as cost, features, or personal preference. Users can utilize the software on their preferred device without being limited by the software's minimum requirements. This aligns with the value of self-direction as it grants users the freedom to make choices and have control over their software usage experience.

Secondly, fixing the issue also supports the value of self-direction by enabling users to tailor their software experience to their specific needs. Not all users have access to the latest devices or can afford to upgrade frequently.

295,Exp B,Exp J,k-9,Data Handling and Storage Challenges,https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/issues/583,"[bug] Attachments showing up on the wrong email I have 2 emails which both have an attachment called external_0.jpg.
When viewing these messages, k9 usually shows the wrong image for at least one of them.
I suspect that FileHelper.createUniqueFile is subject to a race condition when downloading messages and needs a mutex - I'm running on the quad-core Galaxy Note 2. Specifically, multiple copies of SaveAttachmentAsyncTask can be executing at once, and I don't see any critical section / mutex code preventing them executing concurrently.
Checking if (!file.exists()), then writing the file means that two threads can both return the same filepath. Much of the code related to viewing attachments and saving attachments to external storage has been changed recently. What K-9 Mail version are you using exactly? 5.0002 What exactly are you seeing?
Does the attachment box show the wrong thumbnail?
Do you see the wrong image when you click ""Open""?
Do you click ""Save"" and then the wrong image is opened?
5.002 doesn't actually save a copy of the attachment when you click ""Open"".
Only when you click ""Save"" a copy of the attachment is written to external storage. But I believe the code in version 5.002 doesn't allow you to save two files simultaneously (even then, you'd have to click faster than the code can run). So a race condition in FileHelper.createUniqueFile() is probably not the cause of your problem.
Also, I can't find SaveAttachmentAsyncTask anywhere in the code base. It's in src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/ui/messageview/AttachmentController.java https://gist.github.com/DanielHeath/10059376d6d7f6e215c5 has the two messages I'm seeing this on currently.
The inline attachments display the wrong full-size image. Like I said, a lot has changed with that code. For version 5.002 check out the respective tag or the 5.0-MAINT branch.
That being said, displaying inline images is a completely different thing. The relevant code is in LocalStore. There cid: URIs get replaced with content provider URIs. Has there been a play store release since 5.004? No. See Releases and FAQ entry on version numbers. Want me to try 5.105 and see if I can still reproduce? Regardless, FileHelper.createUniqueFile() looks a lot like it suffers from a race condition in general.
Even if it's not the cause of the issue I'm seeing, using it anywhere which could pass the same argument twice from different threads is a bug waiting to happen. We'd love a pull request for the issue in FileHelper.createUniqueFile().
I can't reproduce the issue with the inline images. The cid URI gets correctly replaced with a content URI pointing to the correct attachment. Maybe it's a WebView caching issue.
Feel free to try 5.105, but it does not contain the current code to display inline images. We're in the process of restructuring large parts of the code base to enable PGP/MIME support. Currently master is too unstable to create an alpha/development release. Hilariously, in the 5.0-MAINT branch it's already synchronized, so someone has removed it.

I have two devices running Signal 3.0.2. They were exchanging messages and where having some calls. Now device A reinstalled Signal (resulting in a new identity key) and called device B. The call was established without problems, no warning was given. Writing a message from A to B lead to a warning (""Receives message with unknown identity key...""). Shouldn't be there a warning during the call as well? This allows to impersonate someone else, no? Thats how Redphone works.
I guess you will recognize your partner from the call! @peterpanondrugs But I think you wouldn't know if someone was doing some man in the middle stuff. Though from what I remember Redphone was displaying words that you could exchange to be sure nobody could man in the middle your conversation. RedPhone/Signal uses ZRTP protocol. And ZRTP provides second layer of authentication in the form of key continuity (TOFU - Trust On First Use). So if they called themselves before reinstall, RedPhone/Signal should warn them in following calls if the key has been changed. If it doesn't warn them, there must be some error in RedPhone/Signal implementation of ZRTP. And indeed, key continuity has been supported in old RedPhone: https://github.com/WhisperSystems/RedPhone/commit/2435af9a2a651b5eb269bd891f0788180b8ebed4
But if you look at same files in new Signal, there are many places where this stuff has been commented out, see ZRTPSocket.java from old RedPhone here:
https://github.com/WhisperSystems/RedPhone/blob/master/src/org/thoughtcrime/redphone/crypto/zrtp/ZRTPSocket.java
And compare it to ZRTPSocket.java from new Signal here:
https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/blob/master/src/org/thoughtcrime/redphone/crypto/zrtp/ZRTPSocket.java
Maybe Signal is doing things differently and checking key continuity somewhere else, I don't have now time to check it more thoroughly, but at first look this seems rather fishy (seems like key continuity has been discontinued ;-)).
Please can someone from Open Whisper Systems comment on this? yes you have to verify the sas every time I assume this is temporarily deactivated during the TextSecure+RedPhone-->Signal migration. AFAIK Android Apps are not allowed to acces data from other apps, so TextSecure cannot import the RedPhone keys and therefore has to generate new ones. The new keys would lead to warnings which confuse the users and bring a lot of issue tickets here. ;-) @rmueller83 Yes, after migration you would lose old cached key continuity secrets. But both sides will lose them, so you shouldn't see any warnings - only first call with Signal would have to be verified (with SAS) again, that's all.
This is similar like if someone has removed known_hosts check from SSH, key continuity is basic security feature of ZRTP. I really don't understand why Moxie did it (without at least big warning in README) and really hope that it is only temporary when Signal is in beta. It would be madness to left key continuity checks commented out even in stable/production version... When I understand you correctly, your first paragraph assumes that both sides will upgrade to Signal at the same time. This is normally not the case, as some people upgrade at release day, and others a few days/weeks/months later. @rmueller83 If the other side still has old RedPhone, there still should be warning on that side (because RedPhone doesn't have this key continuity code commented out).

300,Exp B,Exp J,Signal-Android,Security and Privacy Concerns,https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/878,"Prevent Traffic Analysis Traffic and metadata analysis can be a danger to everyone who has to communicate securely.
Actually one could very easy look through the traffic and could guess the length of the actual sent text length. I suggest to send a random amount of fill bytes with every message in order to mask the length of the actual messages.
Furthermore, more complicated approaches like  #328 come to mind; but especially sending dummy messages and dummy content would severly short battery life and increase network usage. I think adding random data to the content of some messages isn't going to make the protection against traffic analysys bombproof, because you could just look up in the source code how many bytes is added at max, calculate the average. Combine that with a lot of intercepted encrypted messages and you can make a really good guess how long messages usually are and at least guess things like which languages are spoken.
It may improve protection against making educated guesses like ""Alice called Bob 50 minutes ago on an insecure line and wanted to meet an hour later. Now she sent him a short message, maybe she is going to run late, or confirming that she just arrived at the destination"" a little, but other metadata like timing , sender and recipient are way more important in modern surveillance.
Your suggestion would just raise the uncertainty about the content a little if the intercepted message were longer. If there were two other messages in the 1 hour timeframe (maybe 1 to Bob, 1 to Carol) possibilities explode.
Maybe she delayed the meeting with Bob, changed the place and invited Carol, maybe she just confirmed to Bob that she got her train and told Carol about the meeting with Bob. Maybe she talks to Carol about her new car...in the first two cases it just became much harder to abduct Alice and Bob at their meeting point without people noticing. Carol may not know anything about their meeting but the adversary can't be sure.
In addition I'm sure that if we keep the number of random messages low (<25/day), the influence on battery drain and transferred data would be so miniscule on both ends that it shouldn't have any noticeable impact.
I'm also positive that the number of people using this feature will be really small - even the number of people ever entering the advanced settings dialog is probably below 1% and only a few high profile or threatened people will use this. In fact, the impact on the network should barely be noticeable. I think adding a random value (or filling it up to certain message lengths, like 0-160 characters, 161-500 characters and 500-1000 characters with a chance of a third that a message with the length of <160 characters is filled up to 500 characters and a message with <500 characters is filled up with up to 1000 characters. most users just send below 160 characters, so most of the traffic is obscured. The random messages could be a deal, though. But it is decision of Moxie and his team whether they say it's security by obscurity and not fitting well into the context of TextSecure or if it's a valuable idea deserving to be part of TextSecure/Whisper. If there where only fixed sizes which are padded to there would be only an amount of different sized messages. There could be a minimal size, for example 32, then padded to 64, 128 256 512 and 1024, from there it could be padded in 512 steps (to have no exponential growth).
For this one has to take into account the Padding oracle attack (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padding_oracle_attack) which can be prevented by appending a HMAC.
But prestructured things can make timing attacks more likely.

The login with Thunderbird and the AquaMail android app works flawlessly.
I'm using the latest K-9-app that is available on the google app store.
The server only supports SSL so I've always set security in K9 to SSL/TLS and authentication to ""Normal password"" since that is the setting that also works in Thunderbird.
""Encrytped password"" does not work either - but that did not surprise since it also does not work in thunderbird.
Would that be worth a try to get a comparison of what is going on?

It's quite interesting since K9 successfully completes the login with a plain username and fails with the username@domain\mailbox form.
On the other hand, Thunderbird has to revert to plaintext instead of base64, too.
Perhaps the problem is the difference between username@domain\mailbox  and username@domain\mailbox.
Both Thunderbird and K9 use the single backslash in the base64-encoded login and Thunderbird succeeds with with a double backslash in plaintext... To add some context here... Access to shared mailboxes in Exchange used to work with <domain>\<ownaccount>\<sharedaccount> or <userprincipalname>\<sharedaccount> and your personal password for both AUTH PLAIN and LOGIN.
Technically AUTH PLAIN supports specifying both an authorization id (mailbox you want to access) and an authentication id (user you want to access it with) in the form /* RFC 4616.2.
The mechanism consists of a single message, a string of [UTF-8] encoded [Unicode] characters, from the client to the server.
As with other SASL mechanisms, the client does not provide an authorization identity when it wishes the server to derive an identity from the credentials and use that as the authorization identity.

If possible it would be best to prevent these thumbnails from containing information in the first place by having the app feed the system a static image such as solid black or black with a logo. Unless I'm misunderstanding, Android versions Honeycomb or higher have the FLAG_SECURE on conversation and conversation list activities, making them protected from screenshots and thumbnails (in normal non-rooted situations). Is this not the case for you? You're correct. What I saw was a thumbnail of my identity fingerprint. Testing on my 4.3 rooted (but stock) it does mask both conversations and the list of conversations.
I apologize. No worries, was a legit concern. Actually, I just checked and, if the app is left while open on a contact verification screen, the thumbnail includes your contact's fingerprint in it's entirety and is easily readable.

I've added a third email client into the mix, thunderbird+enigmail.
Messages passed between k9 and thunderbird in both directions work flawlessly.

It appears that thunderbird+enigmail is smart enough to figure it out anyway.
If you still want to see the messages, I can send them for you, otherwise (and regardless), I'm going to file an issue with roundcube and link back to this. I suspect this is a missing crc issue in ascii armor. This came up in a different place for me recently. Did you send an rc mail to me so I can inspect? Roundcube has confirmed a problem on their side, which is fixed in git master. Once I switched to git master, these problems all disappeared. I sent you a test email from the affected rc 1.2.2 in case it could help with robustness. So what roundcube does here is that it creates clearsigned messages, and wraps them in an encrypted mime part. This is in essence a bastard between pgp/mime and pgp/inline, combining the worst of both worlds. I wonder what they do if you add an attachment?
Either way, while it would be possible to support this for robustness' sake, I firmly believe we should make a decision not to, making sure this format dies as quickly as possible. Closing this issue, if anyone disagrees feel free to reopen.

Social justice is about ensuring fairness and equality in all aspects of society, including access to resources and opportunities. By fixing the issue of unencrypted communication between Textsecure accounts, the software product promotes social justice by providing equal access to privacy and security for all users.

Encryption is a fundamental aspect of maintaining privacy and protecting sensitive information. When communication between Textsecure accounts is unencrypted, it poses a risk to users' privacy and potentially exposes their personal information to unauthorized access. This inequality in access to privacy violates the principle of social justice, as some users are left more vulnerable to privacy breaches than others. By fixing this issue and implementing encryption for all Textsecure users, the software ensures that all users have equal access to privacy and security, regardless of the device they are using.

Furthermore, the Universalism value item is directly supported by fixing ""Issue X"" because it promotes the idea of equal access to privacy and security for all users.

320,Exp A,Exp J,focus-android,Security and Privacy Concerns,https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/454,"From feedback: Seems like I cannot view SSL cert info.
Here's a V1, I've just followed the fennec design for now.
I'm wondering if we should we just use the default material icon (we can use that in the toolbar too?
): https://material.io/icons/#ic_lock AFAICT we can't access EV certificate information when using WebView, at least not without some horrible hacks... https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/http/SslCertificate.html We can get the underlying cert using: http://stackoverflow.com/a/35858045 And then AFAUI we'd need to manually parse the X509 cert to get EV information.
): I don't know if showing the issued to ""CName"" is the right thing for the doorhanger, it looks like Firefox shows the site hostname instead (the CName could be a different host, e.g. when sumo was running on lithium the cert/CName was for something.lithium.com, and support.mozilla.org was one of the alternate domains in the cert).
@antlam: do you have any ideas/designs for the site security doorhanger?
This is not v1 and not nice-to-have though!
:) I guess my main concern is that in most browsers, we're trying to teach users to check when sites are encrypted by using the green lock icon, but in focus we're breaking that expecation.
(I wonder whether it would be considered good UX to also show a broken padlock for http sites?
And should we be using a green padlock to be consistent with most other browsers.)
(I don't know if it's even possible for us to check for mixed content with WebView, so we probably can't even do that part...).
(My branch is at https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/tree/ahunt/sslui - it still needs contentDescriptions added and UX feedback) @brampitoyo thoughts?
This is an area that matches my expertise :-) There are 4 different site states that we‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢ll need to design for.
Here they are, along with accompanying info text: Secure HTTPS (icon: green lock)
domainname.net <green>Secure Connection</green> Verified by: Cert Authority, Inc. (US) No HTTPS ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†in other words, HTTP (icon: none, or grey globe) domainname.net <red>Connection is Not Secure</red> Bad HTTPS (icon: crossed out grey lock) domainname.net <red>Connection is Not Secure</red> We can consider adding explanatory captions like ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†¬¥You should not reveal your personal information (like passwords or credit cards) on this site, because it can be stolen.‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂≈ì√Ñ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†later.
When you tap on it to get more info, then we‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢ll show some colours, as above.
nice!
We should look to align with Photon iconography as well when we get to this.
Photon site info icons Replaced the lock icon with the one used on desktop Photon.
It doesn‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢t look as good as the other ones.
We‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢ll think of something else.
I‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢ve tagged this issue post-v1, so we don‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢t have to worry about it now.
@brampitoyo Are the UX mocks in this bug final?
The green value we use for the icon and text is green-60 #12bc00, and the icon is called Identity Secure.
Unfortunately, the icon you find on the Photon Icon Library is outdated, but Firefox for Desktop already uses the new green lock SVG, with slightly different proportion.
The red value for the text is red-60 #d70022, and the world icon is called Identity Not Secure.
The icon is outdated, but it‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢s all we have at the library, so let‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢s use it for the time being.
And the yellow value for the warning icon is yellow-60 #d7b600, and the icon is called warning-16.
Happy to take this on since this bugs me occasionally.
@brampitoyo wondering if any of these icons need updating from previously specified from the Photon library, etc?
Maybe it will help to have a look at the icons that Firefox for Android uses, and use them for our own design?
After talking with @ekager, we‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢ve decided to follow Fennec‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢s SSL info modal design instead of implementing our own (circa October 2017).
We wanted to look forward, so have came up with the designs above.
This included the SSL info modal.
The only thing we will do differently is to use a dark background for the modal (Fennec uses light).
should follow Fennec.
With out current timeline I guess it's pretty safe to take this over.
I wonder if we can get everything we need for this dialog from WebView.
Maybe it will help to have a look at the icons that Firefox for Android uses, and use them for our own design?
Tagging @brampitoyo for quick review of the three states Hi Emily, you‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢re on the right track!
Just a few items to note, so we can match Fennec‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢s style a bit more: Fennec‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢s warning icon on the toolbar is slightly smaller than ours.
After adding exception, our SSL modal seems to be missing a text that says ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†¬¥You have added a security exception‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´¬¨¬®‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂≈ì√Ñ.
Fennec‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢s icon: 16dp.
Fennec‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢s SSL modal has more top margin (I measured 46dp, but could be wrong) than ours (41dp) When Fennec‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢s SSL modal is opened, the website background is dimmed with a transparent grey overlay.
Hope these changes aren‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢t tricky to make!
Hi @brampitoyo , I've made some changes to the popup.
The warning icon may look bigger but the ImageView is set to 24dp x 24dp so I'm not sure why it would be bigger...
It may just be a more square icon so looks bigger, but I could add a bit of padding when this icon is displayed if this is not acceptable?
So there is no exception text?
The warning icon may look bigger but the ImageView is set to 24dp x 24dp so I'm not sure why it would be bigger...
Maybe it‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢s possible that the SVG used on Fennec has a bigger margin?
I hope it‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢s not just my sights, but I still can‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢t see the shadow.
So then, on this particular scenario, let‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢s change the grey lock icon on the left-hand side of the modal to a yellow warning sign.

Combine that with a lot of intercepted encrypted messages and you can make a really good guess how long messages usually are and at least guess things like which languages are spoken.
It may improve protection against making educated guesses like ""Alice called Bob 50 minutes ago on an insecure line and wanted to meet an hour later. Now she sent him a short message, maybe she is going to run late, or confirming that she just arrived at the destination"" a little, but other metadata like timing , sender and recipient are way more important in modern surveillance.
Your suggestion would just raise the uncertainty about the content a little if the intercepted message were longer. If there were two other messages in the 1 hour timeframe (maybe 1 to Bob, 1 to Carol) possibilities explode.
Maybe she delayed the meeting with Bob, changed the place and invited Carol, maybe she just confirmed to Bob that she got her train and told Carol about the meeting with Bob. Maybe she talks to Carol about her new car...in the first two cases it just became much harder to abduct Alice and Bob at their meeting point without people noticing. Carol may not know anything about their meeting but the adversary can't be sure.
In addition I'm sure that if we keep the number of random messages low (<25/day), the influence on battery drain and transferred data would be so miniscule on both ends that it shouldn't have any noticeable impact.
I'm also positive that the number of people using this feature will be really small - even the number of people ever entering the advanced settings dialog is probably below 1% and only a few high profile or threatened people will use this. In fact, the impact on the network should barely be noticeable. I think adding a random value (or filling it up to certain message lengths, like 0-160 characters, 161-500 characters and 500-1000 characters with a chance of a third that a message with the length of <160 characters is filled up to 500 characters and a message with <500 characters is filled up with up to 1000 characters. most users just send below 160 characters, so most of the traffic is obscured. The random messages could be a deal, though. But it is decision of Moxie and his team whether they say it's security by obscurity and not fitting well into the context of TextSecure or if it's a valuable idea deserving to be part of TextSecure/Whisper. If there where only fixed sizes which are padded to there would be only an amount of different sized messages. There could be a minimal size, for example 32, then padded to 64, 128 256 512 and 1024, from there it could be padded in 512 steps (to have no exponential growth).
For this one has to take into account the Padding oracle attack (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padding_oracle_attack) which can be prevented by appending a HMAC.
But prestructured things can make timing attacks more likely. The SMS transport will always pad messages out to a multiple of the SMS transport size, but that doesn't translate well into the data environment.  Additionally, we're using data structures with varints and other dynamic values in them now, so padding is much harder to calculate correctly.  I think it's unlikely that we'll incorporate these types of countermeasures before the basic functionality is more stable and under control.",Self Direction,Freedom,"Fixing ""Issue X"" contributes to the value of ""Self Direction"" by providing the app users with the freedom to communicate securely and privately.

If you still want to see the messages, I can send them for you, otherwise (and regardless), I'm going to file an issue with roundcube and link back to this. I suspect this is a missing crc issue in ascii armor. This came up in a different place for me recently. Did you send an rc mail to me so I can inspect? Roundcube has confirmed a problem on their side, which is fixed in git master. Once I switched to git master, these problems all disappeared. I sent you a test email from the affected rc 1.2.2 in case it could help with robustness. So what roundcube does here is that it creates clearsigned messages, and wraps them in an encrypted mime part. This is in essence a bastard between pgp/mime and pgp/inline, combining the worst of both worlds. I wonder what they do if you add an attachment?
Either way, while it would be possible to support this for robustness' sake, I firmly believe we should make a decision not to, making sure this format dies as quickly as possible. Closing this issue, if anyone disagrees feel free to reopen.

Bug description
Describe here the issue that you are experiencing.
When you first install Signal, it has link previews enabled by default.
Steps to reproduce
Just install the app.
Actual result:
Notice that ""Send link previews"" is enabled under Privacy in Settings.
Expected result:
This should be disabled by default. It's bad enough that Signal uses phone numbers plus SMS for signup as opposed to usernames plus proof-of-work. At least, we can always get the SMS on one phone, and enter it into another phone, in order to obscure the association between Signal usage, phone number, and IMEI. But with link previews enabled, this all goes out the window. We end up sending our social network configuration to Imgur, Instagram, Pintrest, Reddit, and YouTube in the form of common content fetches within tight time windows. Say I visit reddit/something. Then I send it to you. You're smart about social network reverse engineering, so you do the right thing and delay for a long time (probably days) before clicking the link. But that's defeated by the fact that the link preview hit reddit/something as soon as the phone got the message. As a result, Reddit sees that IP address X and IP address Y hit the same thing at nearly the same time. After a ""few"" more such samples, it works out that the people living at X and Y are associated, probably direct friends. Worse, if we are both logged in, then it knows a lot more about us, perhaps our names and approximate locations. Link previews is great for apps that don't care about anonymity. In Signal, though, it should be opt-in-to-shoot-self-in-foot type of stuff.
The only thing worse is having to report this at Github, which deanonymizes everyone via fckcing 2FA, no stylometry needed! But that's not your fault. Please just consider it as evidence of how concerned I am about this issue.
Finally, links in general shouldn't just fire off the browser when touched. It's just waaay to easy to do that by mistake. Even ignoring all the potential malware ramifications, it's broadly deanonymizing for exactly the reasons stated above. At the very least, it should come up with a dialog saying ""Are you sure you want to effectively tell this website that you're socially connected to your messaging peer? Do you trust this website? Will browsing this link tell your internet provider about you?"" Better yet, have an option to just display links as ""https://..."" so they can be copied into an anonymizing browser elsewhere.

Device: Samsung Galaxy S5
Android 5.0
Signal: 4.42.3 First of all, this is not a bug report, but more of a discussion/feature request. These types of topics are more appropriate for the community forum per CONTRIBUTING.md.
But it seems that you are also not aware of how Link Previews work in Signal at all. You should absolutely read the I link therefore I am blog post or the support article.
Quoting the mentioned blog post (emphasis mine):
The Signal app establishes a TCP connection through a privacy-enhancing proxy that obscures IP addresses from the site that is being previewed.
A TLS session is negotiated directly between the app and the previewed site through the proxy to ensure that the Signal service never has access to the URL. Previews are not generated for non-HTTPS links.
The Signal app retrieves preview images using overlapping range requests so that the proxy service only sees repeated requests for a fixed block size when media is transferred. With reference to the blog post:
The Signal app establishes a TCP connection through a privacy-enhancing proxy that obscures IP addresses from the site that is being previewed.
There is no description of the proxy used in that blog post.  ""Privacy enhancing"" doesn't cut it for me, I'm afraid.
You can also remove any individual link preview by tapping on the ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√¢¬ßX‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢ icon in the corner of the preview before sending a message.
At that point it is too late.
Sending link previews is completely optional
Yes, after you realise that your safety may have been compromised.
It's all very clever, if I trust your implementation.  But by trusting how clever you are, you are deciding to risk other people's safety with the things that you have forgotten.
You are in the business of getting users to trust you.  It is a bug.  Make the default disabled. @privacy-wonk I'll note one thing below, for the rest it's probably better to wait for an official response from the Signal team.
It is a bug.
Referencing CONTRIBUTING.md again (emphasis mine):
Bug reports should only be submitted for existing functionality that does not work as intended.
I believe the fact that the current default (on for new installs and off for existing users before this feature was introduced) is what the developers intended, thus changing this default is actually a feature request/discussion, which should as mentioned above be directed to the community forum. If that was the original intent, then that design decision was fundamentally flawed.  If the CONTRIBUTING.md makes that not an issue, then that document is also fundamentally flawed. As @u32i64 helpfully linked to, we have a blog post on link previews (link) that explains how things work. That post links to our post on giphy search (link), which uses the same proxy. To quote the giphy article:
the Signal service knows who you are, but not what you‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢re searching for or selecting. The GIPHY API service sees the search term, but not who you are
You can sub in ""GIPHY API service"" for any of the sites we're previewing. Same deal.
This feature is working as intended. If you want to discuss this more, feel free to do so on the forum.

331,Exp F,Exp K,Signal-Android,Security and Privacy Concerns,https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/4226,"No warning when getting a call from contact with new key I'm not familiar with the redphone internals, so correct me if I misunderstood something...
I have two devices running Signal 3.0.2. They were exchanging messages and where having some calls. Now device A reinstalled Signal (resulting in a new identity key) and called device B. The call was established without problems, no warning was given. Writing a message from A to B lead to a warning (""Receives message with unknown identity key...""). Shouldn't be there a warning during the call as well? This allows to impersonate someone else, no? Thats how Redphone works.
I guess you will recognize your partner from the call! @peterpanondrugs But I think you wouldn't know if someone was doing some man in the middle stuff. Though from what I remember Redphone was displaying words that you could exchange to be sure nobody could man in the middle your conversation. RedPhone/Signal uses ZRTP protocol. And ZRTP provides second layer of authentication in the form of key continuity (TOFU - Trust On First Use). So if they called themselves before reinstall, RedPhone/Signal should warn them in following calls if the key has been changed. If it doesn't warn them, there must be some error in RedPhone/Signal implementation of ZRTP. And indeed, key continuity has been supported in old RedPhone: https://github.com/WhisperSystems/RedPhone/commit/2435af9a2a651b5eb269bd891f0788180b8ebed4
But if you look at same files in new Signal, there are many places where this stuff has been commented out, see ZRTPSocket.java from old RedPhone here:
https://github.com/WhisperSystems/RedPhone/blob/master/src/org/thoughtcrime/redphone/crypto/zrtp/ZRTPSocket.java
And compare it to ZRTPSocket.java from new Signal here:
https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/blob/master/src/org/thoughtcrime/redphone/crypto/zrtp/ZRTPSocket.java
Maybe Signal is doing things differently and checking key continuity somewhere else, I don't have now time to check it more thoroughly, but at first look this seems rather fishy (seems like key continuity has been discontinued ;-)).
Please can someone from Open Whisper Systems comment on this? yes you have to verify the sas every time I assume this is temporarily deactivated during the TextSecure+RedPhone-->Signal migration. AFAIK Android Apps are not allowed to acces data from other apps, so TextSecure cannot import the RedPhone keys and therefore has to generate new ones. The new keys would lead to warnings which confuse the users and bring a lot of issue tickets here. ;-) @rmueller83 Yes, after migration you would lose old cached key continuity secrets. But both sides will lose them, so you shouldn't see any warnings - only first call with Signal would have to be verified (with SAS) again, that's all.
This is similar like if someone has removed known_hosts check from SSH, key continuity is basic security feature of ZRTP. I really don't understand why Moxie did it (without at least big warning in README) and really hope that it is only temporary when Signal is in beta. It would be madness to left key continuity checks commented out even in stable/production version... When I understand you correctly, your first paragraph assumes that both sides will upgrade to Signal at the same time. This is normally not the case, as some people upgrade at release day, and others a few days/weeks/months later. @rmueller83 If the other side still has old RedPhone, there still should be warning on that side (because RedPhone doesn't have this key continuity code commented out).

334,Exp D,Exp I,Signal-Android,Security and Privacy Concerns,https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/7169,"Feature discussion: Blockchain verified conversations This discussion really applies to the entire Signal stack, but it had to put someplace. Also, I'm not entirely sure signal doesn't already have something like this.
Signal does a great job at client e2e encryption. People mostly seem excited about it's ability to prevent people from listening in on conversations. Aside from encryption GPG also gives us verification that the message originated from a specific individual. I'm curious, what is that verification was taken one step further?
What if a blockchain (of sorts) was kept for each conversation? This way, we enforce the order in which messages were sent and most importantly that message b came directly after message a. Deletion or insertion of messages after the fact would not be possible. Such an implementation would ensure a conversation remains the same between all parties involved and that no individual could inject or remove parts of conversations without the other parties involved noticing.
An example of something like this is how git handles commits. Each commit contains a hash of the current commit (and diff) and the hash of the previous commit. A simple program can then run against the commits to verify the repo is in good order.
In Signal's case, a central authority would be necessary. So the hash chain would probably need to exist on the server. The clients can sync against the hash chain and verify their local conversations match the server's.

By ensuring the order and integrity of messages; this feature promotes true friendship by fostering trust and authenticity in communication; allowing friends to have confidence in the unaltered nature of their conversations.","Fixing ""Issue X"" by introducing blockchain verified conversations aligns with the value of Benevolence, specifically the value item of True Friendship. True friendship is characterized by trust and authenticity in communication, where friends can have confidence in the unaltered nature of their conversations. By implementing a blockchain-like system for each conversation in Signal, it ensures the order and integrity of messages. This feature contributes to fostering trust and authenticity as it prevents any individual from injecting or removing parts of conversations without the knowledge of other parties involved.

With blockchain verification, friends using Signal can have reassurance that their conversations have not been tampered with and that the messages are in the intended order. This reliability and transparency in communication strengthen the bond of true friendship by creating an environment where users can engage in open and honest discussions. It creates a sense of security and stability in the conversation, enhancing the value of Benevolence.

Furthermore, the introduction of blockchain verified conversations supports the value of Benevolence by promoting responsible and accountable communication. By having a central authority maintaining the hash chain, users can verify and synchronize their local conversations with the server's. This encourages users to take responsibility for their messages and ensures that any changes made to the conversation are transparent and traceable. The feature acts as a safeguard against malicious activities, reinforcing the value of Benevolence as it promotes responsible and accountable behavior in communication.

335,Exp F,Exp K,Signal-Android,Security and Privacy Concerns,https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/4995,"Signal will not use permissions with Privacy Guard enabled, nor prompt for confirmation code Cyanogenmod's Privacy Guard has three settings for each permission: Allow, Ask Each Time, or Deny. When set to Ask Each Time it will ask you, every time the app uses the permission, whether you want to allow that. Signal however will not even try.
I don't want Signal to read incoming SMS messages so I ask it to Ask. If it then wants to read the incoming text message, it can ask me, and I can either deny or allow it for that one instance (like when I'm actually waiting for Signal's registration text, I would allow it). Instead, Signal doesn't even try to read incoming texts anymore. This is the first app I ever encountered whose behavior changes after setting it to Ask instead of Allow, so it's probably a bug in Signal (or a feature, if you wrote code to check for permissions).
So if it doesn't even try to use the permission because apparently it assumes it's disallowed or it broke or something, then I would expect a box to be there where I can put in the confirmation code. In fact I'd always expect that box to be there, regardless of whether the app thinks it got its shit together, but that's a separate discussion. Instead what Signal does is let the time expire, then you can request a call (which works), then I reject the call, and then finally I can put in the confirmation code.
(And then what? It says ""could not connect to server"" -- no, right, you only requested an SMS and a call and that worked just fine -- but see my other issue for that.)

In Android >= 5.0 you can use a more secure way of sharing data by using Content Providers. With them you can give the app (& only this app), which receives the file temporary access permissions.
Thus this is a security enhancement.
It might however not work for older apps, which do not support these Content Providers (properly). However a quite large commercial app called Threema uses Content Providers in this way and so it seems that most apps seem to be compatible as otherwise users would complain, which would be very bad for a commercial app. We use content providers in (at minimum) the master branch.

If files are accessed without permission, there is a higher chance of misuse or data leakage, leading to potential harm to the environment.

By implementing a more secure way of sharing files through Content Providers, the risk of unauthorized access and potential harm to the environment is significantly reduced. Content Providers allow for temporary access permissions, ensuring that only the intended app has access to the files. This prevents unauthorized apps from accessing and potentially misusing the files, thus reducing the environmental risk associated with unauthorized access.

341,Exp F,Exp J,Signal-Android,Security and Privacy Concerns,https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/7169,"Feature discussion: Blockchain verified conversations This discussion really applies to the entire Signal stack, but it had to put someplace. Also, I'm not entirely sure signal doesn't already have something like this.
Signal does a great job at client e2e encryption. People mostly seem excited about it's ability to prevent people from listening in on conversations. Aside from encryption GPG also gives us verification that the message originated from a specific individual. I'm curious, what is that verification was taken one step further?
What if a blockchain (of sorts) was kept for each conversation? This way, we enforce the order in which messages were sent and most importantly that message b came directly after message a. Deletion or insertion of messages after the fact would not be possible. Such an implementation would ensure a conversation remains the same between all parties involved and that no individual could inject or remove parts of conversations without the other parties involved noticing.
An example of something like this is how git handles commits. Each commit contains a hash of the current commit (and diff) and the hash of the previous commit. A simple program can then run against the commits to verify the repo is in good order.
In Signal's case, a central authority would be necessary. So the hash chain would probably need to exist on the server. The clients can sync against the hash chain and verify their local conversations match the server's.

@antlam: do you have any ideas/designs for the site security doorhanger?
This is not v1 and not nice-to-have though!
:) I guess my main concern is that in most browsers, we're trying to teach users to check when sites are encrypted by using the green lock icon, but in focus we're breaking that expecation.
(I wonder whether it would be considered good UX to also show a broken padlock for http sites?
And should we be using a green padlock to be consistent with most other browsers.)

The green value we use for the icon and text is green-60 #12bc00, and the icon is called Identity Secure.
Unfortunately, the icon you find on the Photon Icon Library is outdated, but Firefox for Desktop already uses the new green lock SVG, with slightly different proportion.

The icon is outdated, but it‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢s all we have at the library, so let‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢s use it for the time being.
And the yellow value for the warning icon is yellow-60 #d7b600, and the icon is called warning-16.
Happy to take this on since this bugs me occasionally.
@brampitoyo wondering if any of these icons need updating from previously specified from the Photon library, etc?
Maybe it will help to have a look at the icons that Firefox for Android uses, and use them for our own design?

Just a few items to note, so we can match Fennec‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢s style a bit more: Fennec‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢s warning icon on the toolbar is slightly smaller than ours.
After adding exception, our SSL modal seems to be missing a text that says ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†¬¥You have added a security exception‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´¬¨¬®‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂≈ì√Ñ.
Fennec‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢s icon: 16dp.
Fennec‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢s SSL modal has more top margin (I measured 46dp, but could be wrong) than ours (41dp) When Fennec‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢s SSL modal is opened, the website background is dimmed with a transparent grey overlay.
Hope these changes aren‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢t tricky to make!
Hi @brampitoyo , I've made some changes to the popup.
The warning icon may look bigger but the ImageView is set to 24dp x 24dp so I'm not sure why it would be bigger...
It may just be a more square icon so looks bigger, but I could add a bit of padding when this icon is displayed if this is not acceptable?
So there is no exception text?
The warning icon may look bigger but the ImageView is set to 24dp x 24dp so I'm not sure why it would be bigger...
Maybe it‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢s possible that the SVG used on Fennec has a bigger margin?
I hope it‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢s not just my sights, but I still can‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢t see the shadow.
So then, on this particular scenario, let‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢s change the grey lock icon on the left-hand side of the modal to a yellow warning sign.

Supporting this content-type should be the focus for the issue.

When set to Ask Each Time it will ask you, every time the app uses the permission, whether you want to allow that. Signal however will not even try.
I don't want Signal to read incoming SMS messages so I ask it to Ask. If it then wants to read the incoming text message, it can ask me, and I can either deny or allow it for that one instance (like when I'm actually waiting for Signal's registration text, I would allow it). Instead, Signal doesn't even try to read incoming texts anymore. This is the first app I ever encountered whose behavior changes after setting it to Ask instead of Allow, so it's probably a bug in Signal (or a feature, if you wrote code to check for permissions).
So if it doesn't even try to use the permission because apparently it assumes it's disallowed or it broke or something, then I would expect a box to be there where I can put in the confirmation code. In fact I'd always expect that box to be there, regardless of whether the app thinks it got its shit together, but that's a separate discussion. Instead what Signal does is let the time expire, then you can request a call (which works), then I reject the call, and then finally I can put in the confirmation code.

359,Exp F,Exp K,Signal-Android,Security and Privacy Concerns,https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/8280,"Debug log uploader introduced in 4.25.x makes it difficult to remove irrelevant lines I have searched open and closed issues for duplicates
I am submitting a bug report for existing functionality that does not work as intended
I have read https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports
This isn't a feature request or a discussion topic
Bug description
In previous versions of Signal (< 4.25.0), when uploading a debug log via the app it was possible to remove several lines of irrelevant lines at a time by selecting and then deleting them. With the current version, introduced in 4.25, it is now only possible for a user to select a single line at a time, which makes it near impossible to redact large portions of irrelevant debug log.
A privacy-conscious user might want to do this to prevent their being fingerprinting, as the debug logs are public and contain several items that could potentially identify them, including:
Millisecond-precision log entries (which network-observers could use to de-anonymize by correlation)
MAC codes (which could be compared to real packets)
Once a user was identified, further information (especially metadata, using the final 2 digits of interacting phone numbers) could potentially be used. An adversary that had network-level traces and some sophistication could create an automated system to monitor debug logs/reports for information matching a set of users that were of interest, and then harvest this data when it became available.
Steps to reproduce
Select the triple-dot menu in the top right corner.
Go to Settings
Go to Advanced
Click ""Submit debug log""
Select a word by pressing for a long time, then try to expand the selection to cover multiple lines.
Actual result:  You can't :(
Expected result:  You could select and delete irrelevant lines. Modifying the times to either have noise added or be less than millisecond precision could also help preserve anonymity. Perhaps having a ""share lots of info"" vs. a ""share minimal info"" could be another method.

Link to debug log
That's what this issue is about :) This is a bit tricky. Previously, the log was rendered in one giant EditText. However, when our log size increased, some phones would just crash upon viewing the log because their system couldn't support setting that much text in an EditText.
To fix it, each line is rendered in it's own view, which fixed the size limit problem and made scrolling much faster overall. It also means you can do multi-line select.
I imagine one way to lessen the problem would be something like batching n lines together in a view, instead of one-line-per-view. That could let you select more at once. The ""real"" solution would unfortunately be something like importing/creating some custom EditText optimized for rendering large bodies of text, or making some other similarly-large change. Would giving the user an option to select the time period to include help in reducing the EditText buffers?
That would at least work for issues like #8090, where the problem can be reproduced at will and so the window of interest can safely be narrowed down to the past minute or two.
Making the timestamps relative (like dmesg does by default on Linux) might also help improve privacy (unless absolute ones are needed to debug server-side issues). There's no way to retrieve the amount of text that the system can handle displaying in an EditText. It'll just crash or it won't. So giving more options to the user doesn't really help if they just select ""all"", unfortunately. How much buffer is typically required to debug stuff?
If a smaller default (like 10 min) could work, the buffer could substantially be reduced. My phone shows about 2 days worth right now. When it comes to logs, more is almost always better. The original problem was that we only ever had 5-10min of logs, and there's many classes of problems that people don't notice within 10 minutes of the incident. Things like delayed messages, attachments failing to download, missed calls, you name it. That's why I had to write an encrypted PersistentLogger. I won't be reducing the size of the debug log anytime soon :) (Also worth noting that logs are limited by size, not time. 2 days for you might be 2 hours of heavy usage by me).",Security,Family Security,"Fixing ""Issue X"" also supports the value of security; specifically the value item ""Family Security."" By allowing users to remove sensitive and identifying information from the debug log; the software product ensures the security and privacy of not only the individual user but also their family members.

The ability for users to remove sensitive and identifying information from the debug log contributes to their overall security and privacy. By allowing users to selectively delete irrelevant lines, they have greater control over the information that is being shared and can take proactive measures to protect themselves and their family members from potential threats. 

In this case, the debug log contains potentially identifying information such as millisecond-precision log entries and MAC codes. These details could be exploited by adversaries to de-anonymize users and gather further information about them. By being able to remove these lines, the user can ensure that their personal information is not easily accessible.

The importance of security, especially family security, cannot be overstated in today's increasingly digital world.

Bug description
The unlock feature no longer resists social engineering. It currently requires a very commonly used unlock method and credentials instead of a unique unlock method or credentials. (Off topic/rant: Likely, the developers themselves are bugged. It's obvious they do not understand security protocol. By making an rarely used item (signal database encryption) have the exact same unlock method and credentials as a highly used item (a phone) they have shown that they, either, have received money or threats to make it easier to social engineer the unlock method or that they have absolutely no idea regarding how to resist social engineering of unlock credentials in the real world.)
Steps to reproduce
Observe past and current changes to unlock method. Attempt to use unique method to secure signal database
Actual result:
It's extremely easy to social engineer the current unlock method by observing the very common method to access a phone
Expected result:
It's extremely difficult to social engineer the correct unlock method because both the phone and the database should have different unlocking credentials This looks more like a poorly disguised feature request or discussion topic than a bug report.

387,Exp F,Exp K,Signal-Android,Security and Privacy Concerns,https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/7169,"Feature discussion: Blockchain verified conversations This discussion really applies to the entire Signal stack, but it had to put someplace. Also, I'm not entirely sure signal doesn't already have something like this.
Signal does a great job at client e2e encryption. People mostly seem excited about it's ability to prevent people from listening in on conversations. Aside from encryption GPG also gives us verification that the message originated from a specific individual. I'm curious, what is that verification was taken one step further?
What if a blockchain (of sorts) was kept for each conversation? This way, we enforce the order in which messages were sent and most importantly that message b came directly after message a. Deletion or insertion of messages after the fact would not be possible. Such an implementation would ensure a conversation remains the same between all parties involved and that no individual could inject or remove parts of conversations without the other parties involved noticing.
An example of something like this is how git handles commits. Each commit contains a hash of the current commit (and diff) and the hash of the previous commit. A simple program can then run against the commits to verify the repo is in good order.
In Signal's case, a central authority would be necessary. So the hash chain would probably need to exist on the server. The clients can sync against the hash chain and verify their local conversations match the server's.

Fixing ""Issue X"" and introducing blockchain verified conversations in Signal directly supports the value of Universalism, specifically the value item of Equality. By implementing a blockchain-like structure for each conversation, the feature ensures that no individual can manipulate or alter messages without the knowledge and consent of all parties involved. This promotes a sense of equality in communication, as it guarantees that all users have equal access to the same unmodified conversation.

With blockchain verification, each message's position in the conversation is securely recorded and cannot be changed retrospectively. This prevents the deletion or insertion of messages, ensuring that the conversation remains intact and consistent for all participants. By providing this layer of transparency and accountability, the feature empowers users to have equal trust and confidence in the authenticity and integrity of the conversation.

Moreover, the blockchain verification feature also aligns with the Universalism value item of Unity with Nature.

395,Exp G,Exp K,Signal-Android,Security and Privacy Concerns,https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/878,"Prevent Traffic Analysis Traffic and metadata analysis can be a danger to everyone who has to communicate securely.
Actually one could very easy look through the traffic and could guess the length of the actual sent text length. I suggest to send a random amount of fill bytes with every message in order to mask the length of the actual messages.
Furthermore, more complicated approaches like  #328 come to mind; but especially sending dummy messages and dummy content would severly short battery life and increase network usage. I think adding random data to the content of some messages isn't going to make the protection against traffic analysys bombproof, because you could just look up in the source code how many bytes is added at max, calculate the average. Combine that with a lot of intercepted encrypted messages and you can make a really good guess how long messages usually are and at least guess things like which languages are spoken.
It may improve protection against making educated guesses like ""Alice called Bob 50 minutes ago on an insecure line and wanted to meet an hour later. Now she sent him a short message, maybe she is going to run late, or confirming that she just arrived at the destination"" a little, but other metadata like timing , sender and recipient are way more important in modern surveillance.
Your suggestion would just raise the uncertainty about the content a little if the intercepted message were longer. If there were two other messages in the 1 hour timeframe (maybe 1 to Bob, 1 to Carol) possibilities explode.
Maybe she delayed the meeting with Bob, changed the place and invited Carol, maybe she just confirmed to Bob that she got her train and told Carol about the meeting with Bob. Maybe she talks to Carol about her new car...in the first two cases it just became much harder to abduct Alice and Bob at their meeting point without people noticing. Carol may not know anything about their meeting but the adversary can't be sure.
In addition I'm sure that if we keep the number of random messages low (<25/day), the influence on battery drain and transferred data would be so miniscule on both ends that it shouldn't have any noticeable impact.
I'm also positive that the number of people using this feature will be really small - even the number of people ever entering the advanced settings dialog is probably below 1% and only a few high profile or threatened people will use this. In fact, the impact on the network should barely be noticeable. I think adding a random value (or filling it up to certain message lengths, like 0-160 characters, 161-500 characters and 500-1000 characters with a chance of a third that a message with the length of <160 characters is filled up to 500 characters and a message with <500 characters is filled up with up to 1000 characters. most users just send below 160 characters, so most of the traffic is obscured. The random messages could be a deal, though. But it is decision of Moxie and his team whether they say it's security by obscurity and not fitting well into the context of TextSecure or if it's a valuable idea deserving to be part of TextSecure/Whisper. If there where only fixed sizes which are padded to there would be only an amount of different sized messages. There could be a minimal size, for example 32, then padded to 64, 128 256 512 and 1024, from there it could be padded in 512 steps (to have no exponential growth).
For this one has to take into account the Padding oracle attack (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padding_oracle_attack) which can be prevented by appending a HMAC.
But prestructured things can make timing attacks more likely. The SMS transport will always pad messages out to a multiple of the SMS transport size, but that doesn't translate well into the data environment.  Additionally, we're using data structures with varints and other dynamic values in them now, so padding is much harder to calculate correctly.  I think it's unlikely that we'll incorporate these types of countermeasures before the basic functionality is more stable and under control.",Universalism,A World at Peace,"Fixing ""Issue X"" also aligns with the value item of ""Universalism"" by promoting a world at peace.

searched open and closed issues for duplicates
read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports
Bug description
The ""recent photos thumbnails"" shown above the attachment selector does not update itself after opening a conversation.
Steps to reproduce
Open conversation. Open attachment drawer and note thumbnails shown.
Switch to some other app & save image.
Come back to conversation, open attachment drawer and you'll see that the new photo is not shown in the thumbnail list.
Leave the conversation and select a conversation from the main screen. Now try to add attachment and you'll see that the thumbnails have updated.
Actual result:
Thumbnail list is not updated.
Expected result:
It'd be nice if the thumbnail list updated itself at least every time the attachment drawer is opened, if not periodically while the attachment drawer is open.

Not useful here. Good catch, seems like we need a content observer to invalidate that cursor loader I've noticed that those thumbnails don't include videos - could that be related?

I don't get any of those OpenGLRenderer warnings. Seems like this can be caused when rendering large TextViews - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27444387/issue-on-openglrenderer-path-too-large-to-be-rendered-to-a-texture. Might need to set the layerType to software to mitigate, because this is a new device so I doubt it's a legacy problem. I can reproduce it on a LG g2, Cyanogen/Stock Android 5.0.2, TextSecure 2.14.1 2.13 @5boro I'm assuming this is not a consistent thing, and is just with this specifically long text? It is consistent, but seems specific to this text.
Debug log for the LG g2 : https://gist.github.com/anonymous/d45a79c0b0a1c469436b I just noticed that the text in written in white over white background, so the bug is just that there's no background either when sent or received with this text. might be related to #3134 (white cursor)? Just tried a few things, it is length related, and the limit seems to be between 750 and 1000 characters.
The text was over 1700. It's not the number of chars, but the number of lines!
If the background is visible for you, just feed some/many/a big amount of line breaks and the background gets veeery transparent.
Tested on dark theme. no blue bubble background, but visible white characters on black background.
As on dark theme sender and receiver text color is white <> light theme sender:white, receiver:black Good catch, but why wasn't @2-4601 able to reproduce it? @5boro cause copying your text sample here eliminates all the line breaks, when pasted into TS - At least when I was testing. I saved the text (with all 39 lines) to a file and copypasted it to TextSecure from there. Are you on Android >5 @McLoo ?
Because I had the occasion to test it on a few of my friends phone, 2 Galaxy S5 and a Meizu MX3, all were on Kitkat, and the bug wasn't reproducing. I can reproduce this now on my Nexus 4, stock Lollipop 5.1.
It requires 106 or more line breaks (I had also one character/byte on each line when testing).
Here's a debug log where I
send a message with 105 line breaks and it renders correctly
check that the log contains no OpenGLRenderer warnings
send another message with 106 line breaks and the rendering breaks Thanks for the testing all. My guess is that the line-number threshold to set off this error is variable depending on what the device decides is its max OpenGL texture size. Yeah, any bubble > 4096px will cause this error, whether we set the LayerType to software or hardware.
Even more strangely, if we use a ColorDrawable or RectShape drawable instead of a GradientDrawable or RoundedRectShape drawable, this error doesn't happen. It appears Android doesn't handle rounded corners efficiently, making me wonder if we're better off using nine-patches instead of shape drawables for them. Basically we need to not use our own shape-based drawables and move to 9patches. I started the process, but there's a lot of busywork for asset generation and re-aligning stuff.

I'm proposing to add more options with names that hopefully make it clearer which addresses will be selected as recipients.
While it's consistent to say ""reply means reply to sender"", at least for me that is rarely the ""do what I mean"" option I expect from a general ""Reply"" button.
I updated the examples based on @Valodim's feedback.
One thing I don't know how I feel about is the fact that this more or less ignores Reply-To when a List-Post header is present and it's different from the Reply-To address.
This could be useful if someone sends a message to lots of mailing lists but wants to direct replies to a particular list.
One thing I don't know how I feel about is the fact that this more or less ignores Reply-To when a List-Post header is present and it's different from the Reply-To address.
This becomes more ambiguous with mailing lists, which might abuse ""Reply-To"" as ""List-Post"".
From: sender@example.org To: unknown@example.org Reply-To: list@example.org List-Post: <mailto:list@example.org> In this case, ""reply to sender"" should obviously to go sender@example.org, however if Reply-To and List-Post weren't the same I would say ""reply to sender"" should go to what Reply-To says.
But if we name the action ""Reply to sender"" I assume non-technical users would expect that the From address is used.
Then also display the Reply-To address in the message view header and let users figure out that there are more reply options when a Reply-To header is present.
Non-technical users have no concept of a ""from"" header, they just want the message to go to the sender.
We display the information from the From header as sender of the message.
How can non-technical users not be surprised if that information is not used when they click ""reply to sender""?
And we don't display the Reply-To information at all.
""Reply to sender"" would also be the wrong name if it's used like this (message received via list2, but sender wants discussion to happen on list1): From: sender@example.org To: list1@example.org, list2@example.org, list3@example.org Reply-To: list1@example.org List-Post: <mailto:list2@example.org> To me, the most important thing is that ""Reply (implicitly being to the sender"" and ""Replay All (which could involve list-post)"" must be separate and that when people execute the ""reply to sender"" action, the reply should not end up being posted anywhere.
So I think what's needed in MUAs in general, is some way to detect misused From and Reply-To, perhaps by matching up list-post or list-id and values that correspond to those, and in that case, make reply grayed out with a popup that the is misconfigured (or softer  if you are feeling charitable about this, which obviously I'm not) and refuse to perform the action because it can't be done.
Given the reality that Reply-To is used differently than originally intended, I don't think we should call the action ""reply to sender"" if the Reply-To address is used.
My revised proposal: If Reply-To and List-Post are the same, ignore the Reply-To header for all following steps.
If present (and not ignored) use the Reply-To value for the ""reply"" action (don't call it ""reply to sender"", because it might not be).
Use List-Post value and the address that is used for ""reply"" for ""reply to list"".
Use all addresses for ""reply to all"", i.e. also the From address even when Reply-To is present.
I think it's customary for list replies to reply to both list and sender.
Please don't do this, ""reply to list"" should be a separate option and only reply to the list.

Secure Contacts
Other contacts who are able to receive encrypted TextSecure messages are shown in the ""Select Contact"" list with a green bar to the left of their name.
I am using the 'dark' theme and see no indication of whether or not my contact will support encrypted messaging on neither the main list of messages, nor the ""Select Contact"" screen after pressing the + button.
I am not sure as to whether or not this is a regression bug or a difference in themes or a difference in versions.  Please advise as to whether or not this copy should be changed on the Wiki. I see the same regardless of which theme I have selected.
Are you using the latest version 2.0.3? I just upgraded to 2.0.4 and still do not see these indicators.
To be clear, I'm looking at both the main screen, displaying all of my recent texts, as well as the ""Select Contact"" screen after pressing the + button on the main screen.
I do, however, see my texts have a green background, indicating they have been encrypted. Do you see the green bar in the other theme?
About the green background: At the moment, this indicates that the message was sent as an SMS and not via PUSH. So it has nothing to do with the encryption. A message was sent encrypted when there is a lock symbol right next to the time at the bottom at the message.
(There is currently a discussion going on whether the colour green should stand for encryption instead of ""sent via SMS"" in #945.) I updated the wiki to emphasize that the green indicators are for push-registered contacts, not necessarily all contacts that support secure convos. Feel free to re-open if this doesn't address the original concern, but that's what I picked up from this. The bar should be visible in both themes. I updated the wiki to emphasize that the green indicators are for push-registered contacts, not necessarily all contacts that support secure convos.

Hu? Why? We really should also highlight encrypted SMS contacts IMHO.
The main selling point of TS is good encryption. WhatsApp and others do push messaging just fine, but that's not what I'm looking for when I want to write with someone in TS. @Lindworm There's no way to ""know"" whether a contact currently supports encrypted SMS or not. @moxie0 I know, but we could certainly mark the ones that the user has previously communicated securely over SMS with.

Or do something like in the Firefox app; when you long click on the image, it shows the title directly in the heading of the menu (but it is concatenated to two lines of the width of the menu, so for long titles it is not ideal).
I would like to work on this feature.
It is the first time I do that so I am not sure where to start exactly. Can I work on the code directly and just do a PR when I have something that is working? Or is there someone I should contact first? Hey @pgonzalezalv, this is a great idea! We would love a contribution.
You got it! We have a handy getting started guide. You can go ahead and fork the repo and open a PR when you have something that is working and we will review / give any feedback we have.

The ability to freely choose their own goals and customize their app experience is an important aspect of the self-direction value. When the text is cut off and overlaid, it limits the user's ability to fully view and interact with the content, which hinders their freedom to navigate and utilize the software as they desire. By fixing this issue and ensuring that the text is visible and not obstructed, users regain their freedom to access and engage with the information in the app.

Additionally, the issue being resolved supports the value item of independent within the self-direction value. When the text is overlaid, it creates a dependency on the user's system font size, forcing them to adjust it to avoid the issue. This restriction limits their independence and ability to use the software in a way that is most comfortable and suitable for them. By fixing the issue and ensuring that the text is visible regardless of the font size, users regain their independence to choose their preferred settings without any limitations or obstacles.

Lastly, addressing this issue also contributes to the value of privacy within self-direction. When the text is cut off and overlaid, it can potentially expose sensitive or private information to others who may be viewing the screen. This lack of privacy erodes users' sense of control over their own personal data and raises concerns regarding the security of the information they interact with. By fixing the issue and ensuring that the text is fully visible, users can regain their privacy and have confidence that their sensitive information is not being unintentionally exposed or compromised.

In summary, fixing the issue of the text being overlaid by a box directly enhances the values of freedom, independence, and privacy for software users. It allows them to freely choose their own goals, customize their app experience, maintain independence in their settings, and have control over their privacy and security.

That was the plan at some point (see #5891 (comment)), but Lilia and Moxie ended up deciding against it (see #6175). @paride you cannot just remove a member from a group on your device without things going terribly wrong.

I had suggested a single source of truth-device which ""owns"" the group and is the only device capable of sending group updates, but apparently moxie did not like it (and neither did i tbh since it imposes severe limitations to the user).
I am all in for some brainstorming to devise a new groups scheme, but this is not the right place (unlike the forum or the subreddit).
@moxie0 i know you do not want the groups ""to be on the server"", but would storing an encrypted blob (to which the server does not have the key) be ok?

Frequently, new mail simply will not show up if I'm connected to WIFI despite the fact that the Gmail app from Google shows the new email in my inbox.  I can manually attempt to update my inbox and K-9 takes forever to query my inbox on the Google Server and it looks like it may be simply timing out and not connecting to the server but I have no proof of the timeout.

It uses plain_test.html, and it's only being used on AddtoHSTest and CustomTabTest.  I suspect the Focus app instance from CustomTabTest persists beyond the test duration, since it starts with a different activityTestRule than others.
Is this something that we should be worried about? Or is this a new app behavior, and we just simply need to close it from the recent apps list? If one of them is a custom tab then this is intentional. We fixed #770 and now custom tabs and the regular browser are separate things. It looks confusing here because in our test it is Focus that is opening a custom tab in itself. Usually the other entry in ""recent apps"" would look like the app that opened the custom tab. Here is a good example.
All three entries here are actually Focus displaying a website. Two of them show a custom tab (launched from IRCCloud and Yahnac) and the other one is just the regular Focus browser. If I add UI actions at the end of CustomTabTest to close the custom tab instance from the recent apps list, the next test fails to start, with the error of : ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†¬¥java.lang.RuntimeException: Could not launch intent Intent { act=android.intent.action.MAIN flg=0x10000000 cmp=org.mozilla.focus.debug/org.mozilla.focus.activity.MainActivity } within 45 seconds.

But those that arrived during the doze mode in the night are never shown; they are only seen by desktop email clients or using webmail on the smartphone.
The problem does not exist with the current 5.010.
Android version: 6.01 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP Forgot to mention this is an unrooted Galaxy A5 I have a similar problem with 5.111 and CM13, but with K-9 left in the default optimized state.
In the morning (phone not plugged in overnight), emails that arrived overnight are not present.
Even when picking up the phone, unlocking, and going to K-9 they do not arrive.
But, pushing the sync button causes them to load.
I have just changed to 'not optimized' to see if that helps.
I am pretty sure that with 5.010 I didn't have this problem.
The other is that without disabling optimization, K-9 should still schedule wakeups to connect for push/poll occasionally, or at least connect for push and poll (how I have it set) once doze mode is exited and the app is opened.
I'm fine with much higher latency of arrival in doze mode, but it seems that new email ~never arrives after doze without a manual sync.
I.e. if all the email arrives on a subsequent sync it's not this issue.
I want to keep this one concerning emails that are 'skipped' because they hit the mailbox during Doze and never get pulled in a subsequent manual sync.
That's much more serious to me and I've not got a working theory on why it could happen.
@cketti the only thing I can even vaguely think this could be is UIDVALIDITY?
@dikay0 if you can reproduce this issue I'd love to see some device logs for this.
@gdt trying to manually sync does not bring up the emails.
I enabled the ""debug log"" feature but was not able to locate the log on the phone ... some googling seems to indicate that one needs to attach the phone to a PC and run ""adb something"".
@dikay0 Just look in your unified inbox and you will see a local email with the debug log.
@ahmadaamer6 this is not mentioned at https://k9mail.github.io/documentation/debugging.html; does it really work like that?
I don't have a unified inbox (want to keep my accounts separate) but I could enable it.
But when is that ""local email"" sent?
Or once a day?
Or more often?
this morning one email that arrived during the night was missing.
I looked at the debug log (using adb on Linux) and identified the lines that show some kind of error for this message (""CCP4BB Digest - 20 Sep 2016 to 21 Sep 2016 (#2016-260)"").
I cannot interpret these lines but I'm posting them here.
log.short.txt Thanks!
We should be able to fix these :) @philipwhiuk : you didn't elaborate what constitutes the bug, but the impression I get when trying to understand the debug log is that the problem has nothing to do with doze, but rather that this specific email (and others of this kind - digests of mailing lists in my case) triggers some other kind of bug?
@ahmadaamer6 : indeed I found a new (local) folder K9mail-errors under the same account which had an email (created when the error occurred) with a debug log.
It seems to me that it has somewhat less information than what I get with adb but the procedure and existence should really be mentioned/explained at https://k9mail.github.io/documentation/debugging.html !
Should I open an issue for this?
For the record, I paste the contents of the debug log email below: Von: K9mail internal kay.diederichs@xxx.yyy Gesendet: 22.

If you think that'll be insufficient please provide further info. Well, I'm mostly concerned that HSs don't ""just work"" with transparent torification. I don't see a real need to treat .onion domains anyhow differently than normal ones, but #704 could work as well, right.
Interestingly, https://conversations.im also requires explicit ""Connect with Tor"" checkbox ticked to work with HSs; I wonder if it has anything to do with how some networking library / Android API does things - will try to dig around the code a little and see. ...and apparently it does: it's just that (obviously) normal DNS servers don't resolve .onion, and Orbot seemingly doesn't set its own. ...or it actually does, but my phone's DNS for some reason stays as set by network.
Anyway, K-9 does the right thing by just using std Android APIs (and getting an UnknownHostException), so that's out of scope - I'll have to look what Orbot's doing in more detail.

So why is this coming up as of today? I see that it expects a different play store version but why not using the old one? E.G. if one is not able to upgrade the play store. Are you using a custom rom? Normally the play services should update automatically, no? I have 6.5.99 on my phone... Yes, I use OmniRom with a gapps package from paranoidandroid. It was fine until today... So it looks like a problem with your rom...
btw, play services got changed from 6.1 to 6.5 here: 810abe0 Thanks @agrajaghh. The change was made from 6.1 to 6.5 - I see. Seems I have to update play service then.
The dependency on play services is really annoying anyways. Would be so good to have an open source alternative of that. Play services is polluting my phone... I know the blog post about the huge infrastructure that would be needed for a change. It is a pity...

Link to debug log
https://gist.github.com/537972abcf37d7ed356eeaa41cbd65f0 I can confirm that issue with 4.8.10 on HTC 10 stock.
I saw this issue very rarely in the past (one in a few months) but already twice today in different groups with the new beta version 4.8.10. So far I couldn't find a recipient who didn't receive the message but I haven't heard back from all of them. I think this only happens when the sync message fails. The delivery is marked successfull for every regular recipient, but the exception from sending a sync message causes the message to be marked as non-successful.
Since the resend buttons are always attached to recipients (but each button resends the message to all recipients, see #2639 and #3383) users have no way to resend a message whose sync message delivery failed.
I assume your slave device(s) did not receive the message? Okay that was quicker than expected (and maybe we're talking about two different issues here):
For the first message, there is at least one person who did not receive the message. The slave device (desktop client) was not turned on at this time but received the message later.
For the second message, there is at least one person who did receive the message. I think the slave was online. And indeed, the slave device did not receive the message.
So it seems that indeed, some people don't receive the message but the resend button is missing.
When I asked them, people reported that they experienced the same issue in the past days (not on beta).
Regarding the first message: Could this also be related to the slave devices of the recipients? So in the detail view of message 1 there is no resend button for recipient Alice, and Alice definitely did not receive the message?
That is odd. Which signal client (and version) was Alice using? Is the message missing on every device of Alice? Has Alice force-stopped signal/rebooted her phone? Yes, in the group of message 1 there are three other users, let's call them Alice, Bob, Charlie.
There is no resend button for any of them.
Alice did not receive the message and uses Signal on Android. (No beta, I assume a recent version.) Alice does not use other devices.
Bob did not receive the message and uses Signal on Android. (No beta, I assume a recent version.) In the past he also used Signal Desktop (over a year ago).
I haven't heard back from Charlie.
No force-stop or reboot (or anything else that they would consider special.) Do you have a debug log from the sending device after the occurrence? Were subsequent messages ok? I don't have a log sorry. I'll try to get one when I encounter the issue again. Subsequent messages were fine. It'd really be nice if individual status of resend was visible inside the details instead of just one big group.  If I hit ""resend"" it resends to everyone, regardless of status from what I last remember. I got a Not delivered notification in a group chat. No further details in the GUI.
Here is the log. Because there are no time stamps in the log, I'm not sure whether it contains the relevant logging. For sure it contains stack traces:

On a video call, screen turns black (proximity sensor trigger) if phone/sensor is held very close to the face/hand/object
Steps to reproduce
Place Signal (audio) webrtc call
Test proximity sensor, works as expected where screen turns off regardless of landscape or portrait mode
Toggle video call
Test proximity sensor
Actual result: Screen turns black, can not view video call
Expected result: Screen never turns off for video call unless phone is (manually) locked -- this is if either end has triggered the video track.  (WA video call screen auto locks if on video call and app is not in focus on iOS, have not tested other apps or other platforms)

https://gist.github.com/bb8429fa788dc5205ef4f3665f556d8c Why is this unwanted? Normal calls do this too, at least on the Android devices I've been using. I agree, this is the intended behavior. I can't think why you'd want the screen to be that close to your face and still be on? I can't think why you'd want the screen to be that close to your face and still be on?
Perhaps ""hand"" or ""object"" is the actual problem here rather than ""face"" (applies to video calls only).
if phone/sensor is held very close to the face/hand/object Why is this unwanted? Normal calls do this too, at least on the Android devices I've been using.
You don't need the display for normal calls, but you will need it for video calls so it should be active. I can reproduce this. This should be considered a bug.
Other popular video/audio calling systems like WhatsApp and Skype disable this when video call is active. I have been very happy to try out Signal's new video feature yesterday, but the most notable usability issue for my friends used to Facetime and Skype is exactly this bug: the screen (and, from their perspective, the camera, as they lost visual feedback) would turn off when they would reach out to the phone. I had to explain what the proximity sensor was, they didn't understand what was going on at all.
Video calls are different than phone calls: you do not hold the phone to your ear in video calls like you do in phone calls, therefore there's no reason why the proximity sensor should be working. What if we disable the proximity sensor only when your video stream is enabled? I'm thinking that you could have your phone up to your ear when the other party enables video, and then you'd still want the proximity sensor to be on.  Would that satisfy folks? That could work How does Signal iOS currently behave in that regard? I would guess that it makes sense if both clients behaved the same way. @charlesmchen",Security,Cleanliness,"Fixing ""Issue X"" contributes to the value item of Cleanliness in Schwartz's Taxonomy. Currently; the proximity sensor triggers and turns the screen black during video calls; which can be frustrating for users.

It's a bit confusing what clicking on the notification would do. NotificationSessionObserver starts the service from onSessionAdded, so we could just check if its a normal or custom tab session. I should also add for clarity, that the expected behaviour is how the notification used to work prior to this. It gave me context that there was a session still open which had my browsing state set. From our discussion last night on this issue... I don't think we have an option as long as our architecture requires the SessionNotificationService running in the foreground. If the notification service is stopped, our code doesn't persist sessions or fields to disk. It would take a lot of refactoring to make the app function without the service while keeping your session. Without the foreground notification and service or a major refactor to persist everything we need, users would lose their sessions regularly.
There is a lot of confusion from folks who don't know about our early architecture decisions made over a year ago. Users believe the notification is there only because of the action buttons to erase the session.
If we integrate Tor or VPN directly into Focus, we'll require a foreground notification regardless. Right, so @jonalmeida , has this behavior changed in recent Nightlies or you're just mentioning a point of confusion? @ekager like I mentioned above (#3821 (comment)) this behaviour has changed.
Swiping the third party app which had Focus as a custom tab, would dismiss this notification (ending the service). Now, it stays there forever until you actively open Focus from the launcher and then swipe the Focus app away.
I believe that this might be the root cause of #3811 as well. Did a bit of investigation:
onTaskRemoved in SessionNotificationService is not called when a custom tab's app is swiped away. This may have been introduced when we changed our launchMode?
We also start/stop our notification in NotificationSessionObserver, but custom tabs aren't observed here. This also could have been introduced when we switched to the AC Session Manager ( #3179 ).
We could add a check in onDestroy in CustomTabActivity if the sessionManager has no sessions, stop the SessionNotificationService, but I also found a related bug. If you open a custom tab, and click the notification to erase, you're brought to the Focus homescreen which we never want to show in a custom tab.

Anyway, K-9 does the right thing by just using std Android APIs (and getting an UnknownHostException), so that's out of scope - I'll have to look what Orbot's doing in more detail.

One approach to this would be similar to the twitter app, which has an overflow menu on the account creation screen to that links to proxy settings. In proxy settings it'd be nice to have 2 sliders: Enable Tor and Enable proxy like OpenKeychain has. Orbots library allows other apps to start orbot aswell. (It's also probably a better Idea to route all traffic through the proxy/tor, This way you can deny internet access to k9mail in your firewall app which prevents exploits from leaking your real ip) When #1181 and #1182 get merged it will mean that WebDAV should support using a proxy for a secure connection.

It needs rebasing, again ( :/ ) and then merging. There's no roadblock. It mainly needs someone to implement the functionality mentioned in the first post. But it's a lot of work and needs to be done carefully because of the privacy implications when people start using the feature with Orbot.
But it's not a very important feature to many people and hence not a priority.
If someone wants to work on this feature please make sure to read this comment first: #2571 (comment) On the contrary @cketti , this is a VERY important privacy feature.  But there is another easier way that this could work, without implementing network proxies inside k9mail.
Firstly, to use k9-mail through orbot you need to use AFwall.  Its a must.  why? because you can force all connections to go through VPN tap adaptor in AFWall settings.
Then you have to configure orbot to be used as a VPN -> switch to VPN-Mode.  Then you need to allow the apps you want to pass through orbot, in this case k9-mail.
Once you connect orbot to the network, AFwall forces all connections through to orbot VPN.
Now the only thing that SHOULD be implemented in k9-mail, is account-related VPN toggle switches.
Which means that, say for example you have set up an email account. You want to long press the account and see a setting called Switch VPN adapter.  Choose from which VPN this account will pass through permanently so that there are never any leaks (even though AFWall protects against leaks anyway).
This switch would have 3 options.   Choose Orbot VPN, Choose OpenVPN Connect and OFF(to use normal traffic)
Basically this switch would read from the same options thats inside the android settings > VPN (under lineageOS atleast) thats where it shows Orbot VPN & OpenVPN Connect(if you have it).
I think account-separated VPN toggle switch would insure that your email account passes through the correct tap adapter.
Can anyone concur? One more usecase : gmail usually blocks access for me when retrieving mail from new country - this is quite annoying when travelling. I solve this on desktop by proxying through my server and it would be awesome to have same soluiton on android. So for this usecase only support for POP/IMAP/SMTP connections is required. Maybe this is easier milestone to reach. Check my commit.

This means that less data needs to be transferred, reducing unnecessary data consumption and potentially minimizing the environmental impact of internet usage.

When users download remote content displayed in WebView or long-press to download remote images without the use of a proxy, it requires direct data transfer between the user's device and the server hosting the content. This can lead to increased data usage, especially if the content is large or if users frequently access such content.

558,Exp C,Exp H,Signal-Android,Connectivity and Network Problems,https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/682,"Cannot delete contact key You can only confirm the key, you cannot remove it currently.
Yep.
:-( I've currently got a contact that I can receive messages from but I can't send them any (I can send, but they don't receive them).
I was trying to delete the key to start over, only to notice that I can't.
@Gnarfoz it sounds like your issue is unrelated to key management.
My guess is that the user you're communicating with is registered on more than one TextSecure server simultaneously, so your messages are going to the wrong place.
It's not possible to register one device with two separate TextSecure servers simultaneously and get consistent results.
I have a friend who uninstalled TextSecure, but my TextSecure keeps sending encrypted messages to him.
Anyway to delete his contact key?
@mingtang: I'm in a similar situation.
As a work around, you should be able to long press the send button and hit ""Send unencrypted"" to send a message to them.
@rmoore Yeah, that works for now, but isn't viable long term solution.
The only other workaround is to clear the app data for TextSecure and start fresh, but I would like to avoid that if possible.
This is also relevant when somebody previously using WhisperPush installs TextSecure.
This issue should be more general, key rollover or multiple keys per contact should be an option @lorenzhs Key updates and detecting old sessions are fully baked into the new protocol and require no manual intervention.
WhisperPush is using an older version of the protocol, which is why problems are happening there.
I'll work with Cyanogen to get WhisperPush updated.
@moxie0 Indeed, my communication partner had previously registered with CyanogenMod's WhisperPush.
So it was an episode of #610. i would like to remove a key.
it's the old temporary number of a contact.
his original number has been ported now and the old number thus is gone and as such can not be deregistered as the number doesn't exist anymore.
an option to combine threads would be super.
as if i remove the temporary/non existent number from the contact, it becomes a ""name less"" conversation thread.
i guess this is something that can be avoided, once email based identification is implemented and used.
I need to remove a key as well, or at least I need to remove my relationship to a key.
I installed TextSecure on my Galaxy Note 2 running Cyanogenmod 10.2 (Android 4.3), and had my wife try installing it on her Galaxy S4.
She didn't like the layout and uninstalled TextSecure, but my phone still tries sending encrypted messages to her on the IM side rather than over SMS.
I tried using the Send Unencrypted option, but on my phone that option does not work.
My wife never gets the message.
I can only send messages to her now using the default Messaging app, but I can receive them from her in TextSecure.
I tried wiping my local TextSecure data and start over.
I had to re-register with TextSecure, but as soon as I sent my first text to my wife, her key was downloaded again and the text went encrypted to the IM network and not over SMS.
She hasn't received any messages from me through TextSecure since she uninstalled the app.
This is a major problem!
The latest update has a way to relieve this.
Start up a conversation with the contact and press the lock icon and ""End Secure Session"" and that should end session and you'll be able to have unsecured SMS conversations with the contact again.
I'm having the same issue as honshu4.
I've tried clicking the lock button and selecting ""End Secure Session.""
However, when I send a message, it flashes green for a second and then switches blue, and the message is never received on the device that has uninstalled TextSecure.
I am able to go into setting and turn off ""Push messages"" to send a SMS to the device that uninstalled TextSecure, but this isn't a great option.
This issue is unrelated to ""keys.""
Users should never have to manage or think about the lifecycle of secure sessions in textsecure v2.
If someone is registered with the textsecure server, messages will go to the textsecure server.
if they unregister, messages will not flow to the textsecure server anymore.
If someone uninstalls the app, GCM will eventually notify us, but it doesn't happen immediately.
This is a limitation of GCM.
@attspa The advise provided by @mingtang worked for me.
After you end the encrypted session, you might try deleting that session and starting a new one.
That's what I did, and everything seems to be working fine now.
Tried again, I am able to see the message saying ""Secure session ended.""
Tried deleting the session, and this did not change the result.
moxie, could you please let us delete the contact keys?
Let us long press them for deleting, add a warning and everything would be fine.
+1 to @Waboru .. long-press, are you sure, delete was the exact flow I and a friend expected to work +1 imagine someone interferes with key exchange, you verify the key in reality and see it doesn't match.
What's interesting is that almost everything people have listed here about why they want to manage these keys would actually not be solved by the ability to manage these keys.
Well, key related or not, the underlying problem persists.
A friend of mine broke his phone display and now uses an old Nokia brick and there is no way now to contact him, because ending the secure session does not work (problem as described above), long-pressing for unsecured sending does bot work (as above), starting a new thread does not work either, despite being green rather than blue, which makes me think that messages are sent over the server anyway rather than per SMS - he never gets anything.
Since his phone broke, he didn't uninstall his app, so no feedback there.
There really needs to be a way to unlink him from my TS contacts.
Same problem here.
My girlfriend switched to an iphone and now I've to manually send each message as unencrypted SMS, else she wouldn't receive the messages.
There's no possibility yet to unlink a contact from TextSecure, right?
you could register with the phone # and then unregister.
never tried, but theoretically it should work without even having the sim card of the number you want to control, as long as you can get the verification code.
i too really wish TS would get a better UX for this and the announced optional phone-number independent identification way.
Unregistering and re-registering didn't work for me.
I can't get my ID key off of my friend's phone.

Have a member of a group unsubscribe from Signal

Now the stale number is impossible to remove from the group. Sometimes re-registering is not an option, as access to the number might have been lost. Most of the time the user just doesn't care.
Expected result: The unsubscribed user is automatically removed from all the groups. I know the server is not aware of groups, but I think there are still ways to handle this. For example:
When sending a message to a group (i.e., to all the group members), if a user is not a Signal user anymore, remove it;
Before adding a user to a group because of a message coming from another group member, check if the number is actually a Signal number.
Signal version: 4.8.0 This is unfortunately technically infeasible with the current group architecture and was rejected in #828. @nrizzio How is my proposal incompatible with the current architecture? There's no need for a group administrator (what #828 is about). My interpretation may very well be incorrect. In the interest of reducing notification spam, I'm going to take a step back and let Moxie make a determination when he gets around to it. Feel free to make a thread on the forum though.

That was the plan at some point (see #5891 (comment)), but Lilia and Moxie ended up deciding against it (see #6175). @paride you cannot just remove a member from a group on your device without things going terribly wrong.
So far no one has come up with a scheme for removing group members in asynchronous egalitarian groups that is simple and works.
I had suggested a single source of truth-device which ""owns"" the group and is the only device capable of sending group updates, but apparently moxie did not like it (and neither did i tbh since it imposes severe limitations to the user).
I am all in for some brainstorming to devise a new groups scheme, but this is not the right place (unlike the forum or the subreddit).
@moxie0 i know you do not want the groups ""to be on the server"", but would storing an encrypted blob (to which the server does not have the key) be ok?

Additional Info
The Thunderbird error turns out to be insufficient. The error message ""wrong password"" is not true. Nothing has changed with my password. The problem turns out to be the maximum allowed connections! And the problem always starts with ""Show all folders"" in K9-Mail. By allowing more connections on the server side resolves the issue temporarily/shortly.
I guess, K9-Mail invokes too many connections, presumably one for each folder, without closing these. On a mail server where this number of connections exceeds, other clients cannot access anymore. Same password, which used be working and still is working with K9-Mail and Webmail, stops working for other clients (Thunderbird in this case). But the problem isn't Thunderbird or the password.
I think solution would be to tightly limit outgoing IMAP connections by default. I didn't find any option to this in the settings. K-9 uses N+1 connections where N is the number of folders you have configured to use PUSH email.
PUSH email by design requires one connection per folder. You can configure which folders are set to use PUSH. If you set more to PUSH than you are allowed, then you will run out. Unfortunately there is no deployed 'PUSH FOR SELECTED FOLDERS' behaviour in IMAP that would allow us to use less than this.

Let me further clarify why I labeled 'Issue X' relevant to Protecting the Environment and its corresponding value Universalism from a ""Software User"" perspective within a software product context.

When discussing the rejection of HEAD requests by some servers, the main concern is the unnecessary consumption of resources. By sending a HEAD request, the software product only retrieves the response code and not the entire response body, thereby reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred over the network. This reduction in data transfer contributes to a more efficient and environmentally-friendly use of resources.

In the context of the internet ecosystem, reducing data transfer has a direct impact on the environment. The energy consumption associated with data transmission, especially over large distances, leads to carbon emissions and contributes to climate change. By minimizing the amount of unnecessary network activity, the software product indirectly supports the value of protecting the environment by reducing its ecological footprint.

Additionally, promoting efficient network communication aligns with the value of Universalism. Universalism emphasizes the importance of considering the well-being of all individuals and the planet as a whole. By implementing practices that reduce data transfer and promote sustainability, the software product demonstrates a commitment to universal values and contributes to a more harmonious and balanced world.

Use what I‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢ve suggested up there. Summarising my conversation with @ekager about the cookie blocking state in each menu item:
Enabled = no cookies blocked
Enabled, excluding 3rd party = some cookies blocked
Disabled = all cookies blocked Hey @brampitoyo quick question from the user perspective. Should cookies clear if I turn off cookies while in a session? For example if I log into Twitter, then go turn off Cookies, Twitter reloads and I'm not logged in. But if I go back and turn on Cookies again, I'm logged in. Is this expected? Hi @ekager, the behaviour you noted is as expected.
Users who have turned their cookies off do expect their login state to change. If they were signed in when cookies is enabled, they‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢re not going to be signed in when cookies are disabled.
When cookies is re-enabled, I would expect whatever problems I‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢ve had to be fixed. This means that the cookies that Focus had stored should be restored, as long as the garbage bin icon hadn‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢t been tapped. Additionally, this is how the TP toggle should behave in response to different cookie states.
Cookie states does not impact the TP toggle. Whatever cookie state you have set, TP toggle is set to on by default.
On the other hand, the TP toggle does impact cookie states. Whatever cookie state you have set, when TP toggle is set to off, cookie state must be set to enabled.
By accepting all cookies, we will ensure that website problems have a higher chance to be solved when the TP toggle is turned off. @brampitoyo I think we do need new strings. We're already using a ""Block xxx xxx"" construction for TP. This structure aligns with that:
Block cookies
Yes
Block 3rd-party cookies only
No
Also not confident most users will understand reference to 3rd-party cookies. Looks good to me! @BrianNJones and @brampitoyo are these the final strings for this feature? I agree with @BrianNJones about using the ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†¬¥Block‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂≈ì√Ñ verbiage to match with other menu items. Let‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢s use that.
I similarly worry about user understanding of 3rd-party cookies. SUMO wrote a great plain language explanation:

603,Exp C,Exp H,focus-android,Miscellaneous Software Issues,https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/123,"Consider switching to regex for content blocking I just learned iOS uses regex for content blocking (I'd assumed the browser did the same as the safari content blocking, but that's not the case). They use regex - I ended up building a trie-based system (which I think is what regex uses internally anyway - but regex is more complex):
https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus/blob/master/Blockzilla/LocalContentBlocker.swift#L174
We could consider switching to regex too, which would let us discard some code and also copy iOS's regex building (instead of our own blocklist parsing + trie construction). This might result in better performance, or might result in worse performance (our implementation supports a lot less than regex, so should be simpler and therefore faster - but Java regex could be implemented better / more efficient - I simply don't know).
This isn't needed for v1, and could possibly result in worse performance. It would be interesting to get a memory/performance comparison to determine that. Given that the current code works well (and has a full test suite), there's no real reason to change it - but it might save maintenance work in future (or it could be worse for maintenance, since it's regex).
(I'm filing this mainly for knowledge's sake, and I don't think there's any value in doing this anytime soon.) This isn't of huge importance, but I'm implementing an iOS-inspired UrlMatcher just to allow comparison of results - which should help catch bugs in the original version if present. I'm planning to run both matchers in parallel in debug (and probably beta) builds, and we can then throw exceptions (which results in crash reports) if results don't match. The good:
My custom implementation is approx 100-200x faster than the iOS approach (I've ported the code as close to 1:1 as possible). I.e. up to 0.2ms per resource with the current code, compared to ~42ms per resource with the regex implementation (on a N6P).
The bad:
There's one bug in the current implementation where we block too many sites:
-- twitter.com is defined as blocked in the blocklist (unless you're on a twitter property)
-- My intitial implementation also blocks ads-twitter.com (which is a  different domain), the iOS version (and ported code) doesn't. (I've got a fix for this.)
(ads-twitter.com should probably be on the blocklists, but that's a separate issue - and we should only block sites that are actually on the blocklist)
I've not had any other issues, I'm thinking it's probably best to enable both versions only in debug builds for now so we can see if any other bugs turn up - I'd still be keen to enable more widely on beta to see if there are any other bugs lurking in either version at some point. Closing since performance is much worse and we'd therefore definitely not want this, and both implementations have identical results.",Universalism,Protecting the Environment,"Fixing ""Issue X"" by switching to regex for content blocking demonstrates a commitment to protecting the environment.

By implementing this change; the software aligns with the value of protecting the environment within the universalism value item.","Fixing ""Issue X"" by switching to regex for content blocking can contribute to protecting the environment in several ways. First, the use of regex allows for more precise identification and blocking of content that may promote or enable environmentally harmful practices. By leveraging the pattern matching capabilities of regex, the software can effectively target websites or resources that contain information or activities related to pollution, unsustainable practices, or other ecological issues. This targeted blocking helps in preventing users from accessing or being exposed to harmful content, thereby promoting a cleaner and more sustainable environment.

Additionally, the switch to regex for content blocking can also align with the value of universalism from Schwartz's Taxonomy. Universalism emphasizes the importance of considering the welfare and well-being of all individuals and the broader world community. By incorporating regex-based blocking, the software demonstrates a commitment to protecting the environment for the benefit of all users and society as a whole. It recognizes the shared responsibility we have in preserving the environment and taking collective action to address environmental challenges.

634,Exp F,Exp K,focus-android,Miscellaneous Software Issues,https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/123,"Consider switching to regex for content blocking I just learned iOS uses regex for content blocking (I'd assumed the browser did the same as the safari content blocking, but that's not the case). They use regex - I ended up building a trie-based system (which I think is what regex uses internally anyway - but regex is more complex):
https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus/blob/master/Blockzilla/LocalContentBlocker.swift#L174
We could consider switching to regex too, which would let us discard some code and also copy iOS's regex building (instead of our own blocklist parsing + trie construction). This might result in better performance, or might result in worse performance (our implementation supports a lot less than regex, so should be simpler and therefore faster - but Java regex could be implemented better / more efficient - I simply don't know).
This isn't needed for v1, and could possibly result in worse performance. It would be interesting to get a memory/performance comparison to determine that. Given that the current code works well (and has a full test suite), there's no real reason to change it - but it might save maintenance work in future (or it could be worse for maintenance, since it's regex).
(I'm filing this mainly for knowledge's sake, and I don't think there's any value in doing this anytime soon.) This isn't of huge importance, but I'm implementing an iOS-inspired UrlMatcher just to allow comparison of results - which should help catch bugs in the original version if present. I'm planning to run both matchers in parallel in debug (and probably beta) builds, and we can then throw exceptions (which results in crash reports) if results don't match. The good:
My custom implementation is approx 100-200x faster than the iOS approach (I've ported the code as close to 1:1 as possible). I.e. up to 0.2ms per resource with the current code, compared to ~42ms per resource with the regex implementation (on a N6P).
The bad:
There's one bug in the current implementation where we block too many sites:
-- twitter.com is defined as blocked in the blocklist (unless you're on a twitter property)
-- My intitial implementation also blocks ads-twitter.com (which is a  different domain), the iOS version (and ported code) doesn't. (I've got a fix for this.)
(ads-twitter.com should probably be on the blocklists, but that's a separate issue - and we should only block sites that are actually on the blocklist)
I've not had any other issues, I'm thinking it's probably best to enable both versions only in debug builds for now so we can see if any other bugs turn up - I'd still be keen to enable more widely on beta to see if there are any other bugs lurking in either version at some point. Closing since performance is much worse and we'd therefore definitely not want this, and both implementations have identical results.",Achievement,Intelligent,"Fixing ""Issue X"" by switching to regex for content blocking improves the intelligence and capability of the software.

This doesn't seem like a sustainable testing strategy, ultimately can't the harness be external to the apk? I think we could have checked that the commit didn't break all tests before merging it into master. when we update the gradle build plugin there will always be a chance that we will need to change the syntax of our build.gradle, this time it affected the syntax we use for our test build types, next time it will be something different.
I don't agree that this has anything to do with our testing strategy. all android test frameworks (official and 3rd party) are built off the idea that a test suite is comprised of two APKs:
the apk of the application under test
the instrumentation apk, used to manipulate the application under test, basically a test harness
my understanding is that the instrumentation apk must be built against the application apk, always, everything I've read states this as a given and every build.gradle also, some reasons I can extrapolate are:
for basic unit tests the instrumentation apk definitely needs access to application classes else there would be nothing to unit test.
for UI tests such as UIAutomator, Espresso, and some Robolectric stuff the instrumentation apk needs access to the generated application R.* for matching UI elements.
if we separated the code under test and the testing code into two repos, the instrumentation apk would still have to be built against the application apk, so one would need to be merged into the other at test time. the repo that builds the instrumentation apk would need to simultaneously merge into master, RC branches, and every PR without merge conflicts. also to build the instrumentation apk we must know what build type (and potentially flavor) of the application apk to build against, and to run the tests we must know the filename of the resulting application apk, both of these things can be changed explicitly in build.gradle (as was done in the above referenced commit) or unintentionally by updating gradle build tools (as was done in the above referenced commit).
I think that what we have is as good as it gets for now, the limitations of our current setup being that:
when we update gradle build tools we may need to update our build.gradle syntax on master.
when build.gradle on master changes the name of the test build types, PRs will fail until they rebase.
when build.gradle on master changes the filename of the resulting test apks, PRs will fail until they rebase.

This doesn't seem like a sustainable testing strategy, ultimately can't the harness be external to the apk? I think we could have checked that the commit didn't break all tests before merging it into master. when we update the gradle build plugin there will always be a chance that we will need to change the syntax of our build.gradle, this time it affected the syntax we use for our test build types, next time it will be something different.
I don't agree that this has anything to do with our testing strategy. all android test frameworks (official and 3rd party) are built off the idea that a test suite is comprised of two APKs:
the apk of the application under test
the instrumentation apk, used to manipulate the application under test, basically a test harness
my understanding is that the instrumentation apk must be built against the application apk, always, everything I've read states this as a given and every build.gradle also, some reasons I can extrapolate are:
for basic unit tests the instrumentation apk definitely needs access to application classes else there would be nothing to unit test.
for UI tests such as UIAutomator, Espresso, and some Robolectric stuff the instrumentation apk needs access to the generated application R.* for matching UI elements.
if we separated the code under test and the testing code into two repos, the instrumentation apk would still have to be built against the application apk, so one would need to be merged into the other at test time. the repo that builds the instrumentation apk would need to simultaneously merge into master, RC branches, and every PR without merge conflicts. also to build the instrumentation apk we must know what build type (and potentially flavor) of the application apk to build against, and to run the tests we must know the filename of the resulting application apk, both of these things can be changed explicitly in build.gradle (as was done in the above referenced commit) or unintentionally by updating gradle build tools (as was done in the above referenced commit).
I think that what we have is as good as it gets for now, the limitations of our current setup being that:
when we update gradle build tools we may need to update our build.gradle syntax on master.
when build.gradle on master changes the name of the test build types, PRs will fail until they rebase.
when build.gradle on master changes the filename of the resulting test apks, PRs will fail until they rebase.

682,Exp F,Exp K,focus-android,Miscellaneous Software Issues,https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/123,"Consider switching to regex for content blocking I just learned iOS uses regex for content blocking (I'd assumed the browser did the same as the safari content blocking, but that's not the case). They use regex - I ended up building a trie-based system (which I think is what regex uses internally anyway - but regex is more complex):
https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus/blob/master/Blockzilla/LocalContentBlocker.swift#L174
We could consider switching to regex too, which would let us discard some code and also copy iOS's regex building (instead of our own blocklist parsing + trie construction). This might result in better performance, or might result in worse performance (our implementation supports a lot less than regex, so should be simpler and therefore faster - but Java regex could be implemented better / more efficient - I simply don't know).
This isn't needed for v1, and could possibly result in worse performance. It would be interesting to get a memory/performance comparison to determine that. Given that the current code works well (and has a full test suite), there's no real reason to change it - but it might save maintenance work in future (or it could be worse for maintenance, since it's regex).
(I'm filing this mainly for knowledge's sake, and I don't think there's any value in doing this anytime soon.) This isn't of huge importance, but I'm implementing an iOS-inspired UrlMatcher just to allow comparison of results - which should help catch bugs in the original version if present. I'm planning to run both matchers in parallel in debug (and probably beta) builds, and we can then throw exceptions (which results in crash reports) if results don't match. The good:
My custom implementation is approx 100-200x faster than the iOS approach (I've ported the code as close to 1:1 as possible). I.e. up to 0.2ms per resource with the current code, compared to ~42ms per resource with the regex implementation (on a N6P).
The bad:
There's one bug in the current implementation where we block too many sites:
-- twitter.com is defined as blocked in the blocklist (unless you're on a twitter property)
-- My intitial implementation also blocks ads-twitter.com (which is a  different domain), the iOS version (and ported code) doesn't. (I've got a fix for this.)
(ads-twitter.com should probably be on the blocklists, but that's a separate issue - and we should only block sites that are actually on the blocklist)
I've not had any other issues, I'm thinking it's probably best to enable both versions only in debug builds for now so we can see if any other bugs turn up - I'd still be keen to enable more widely on beta to see if there are any other bugs lurking in either version at some point. Closing since performance is much worse and we'd therefore definitely not want this, and both implementations have identical results.",Self Direction,Independent,"Fixing ""Issue X"" by switching to regex for content blocking allows users to have more control and independence over what content they want to block.

With the current implementation, users are limited to the predefined blocklist and trie-based system. By incorporating regex, users can create their own rules and patterns for content blocking, expanding their ability to tailor the browsing experience to their liking. This flexibility not only provides a higher degree of control but also enables users to adapt the software to their unique requirements, whether it's blocking specific websites, filtering certain types of content, or personalizing the level of strictness in blocking.

Moreover, the switch to regex also aligns the software product with the practices and expectations of the broader software development community.

###Expected behavior
When I go mobile, i use the search function to find small number of inbox emails. results used to be immediate (even when using same phone).
Actual behavior
results take a long time to return the 4-6 messages i'm asking for. the screen will display ""working"" clock, then go blank, sometimes finish if i wait long enough, but i mostly quit waiting after (what seems like) 30-60 seconds.
all other functions seem normal.
Steps to reproduce
have 250 emails in inbox, about 6 of which would return from the 1-word search term found in ""subject"" field
be mobile, on cell data, battery-powered, nearly fully charged
tap search button, enter 7-character word and ""go""

IMAP Is this searching on the server or on the device? If you're searching on the server on a fairly bad mobile connection it will be slow. the account settings, search, ""enable server search"" is unchecked/false.
thnx same here,  mobile search without server,  single word query on 200 email takes more than a minute and k9 freezes and screen goes black.
behavior started about 2 months ago. this is extremely annoying. I've started logging about 2 weeks ago,  but where is the debug log stored? This might be fixed by the re-addition of table indexes in #2158

Users will have the freedom to quickly and efficiently search for specific inbox emails; giving them control over their email management and saving them time and effort.,"Fixing the slow search function in the app directly enhances the value of Freedom in the Self Direction category. The value of Freedom in terms of self direction encompasses the ability to independently choose and achieve one's own goals. In the context of the software user, having a fast and efficient search function provides them with the freedom to quickly access and retrieve specific inbox emails, allowing them to navigate and manage their email communication in a self-directed manner.

By addressing the slow search issue, users are no longer limited by a time-consuming search process, giving them control over their email management and saving them valuable time and effort. They are able to independently determine which messages they want to access and respond to promptly, facilitating their ability to prioritize and address important communication in a self-directed manner. This enhancement not only improves the overall user experience but also aligns with the value of Freedom, which emphasizes independence and the ability to choose and act according to one's own goals and preferences.

Additionally, the fast and efficient search function contributes to the value of Freedom by reducing frustration and enhancing user satisfaction. When users encounter a slow search function, they may experience a sense of restriction and loss of control over their email management. However, by fixing this issue, users regain the freedom to search and access their desired inbox emails seamlessly, resulting in a more positive and empowering experience. This improvement aligns with the value of Freedom in the context of self direction, as it allows users to exercise autonomy and agency over their email communication.",Agreed-Justified,Agree,,Agree,

Hello, note that I tried to reproduce this issue on the following builds and devices:
Firefox Preview Latest Nightly 1/14 GV 74
Firefox Preview Beta 3.1.0-beta.3 GV 7
Firefox Preview RC 3.0.2 GV 71
Firefox Focus 8.025(Build #340092236) GV 71

Google Pixel 3a XL(Android 10)
Note that I was not able to reproduce the issue, I will keep an eye for this while testing and come back with more information in case I can reproduce it. @abodea, here is a gist with the Firefox Focus crash. It also contains the Firefox preview logs I recorded. Let me know if it was captured properly and if I can do anything else to help. I'm having this issue as well and have attached logs.  I have also been having the same issue with Firefox Preview.
logs-2020-01-11-10-56-45.zip This seems to be related to bug #7803 on Fenix; Focus will crash if I'm connected to a VPN when I open it, but not if my VPN is inactive.  I'm using ProtonVPN 2.0 app. Oh, thanks for the additional info @bthylafh! I can confirm that the issue only affects me when I use the OpenVPN setting from ProtonVPN 2.0. It does not happen when I use IKEv2 in ProtonVPN 2.0 or when I use PIA VPN. I confirm that Focus crashes with Proton VPN 2.0 in OpenVPN mode, but not
in IKEv2 mode.
I installed Firefox Klar from F-Droid and it works fine either way. Note
this is an older version, 8.0.15, so whatever broke on Focus/Klar is in a
more recent version.

While connected to a VPN server (OpenVPN for Android, de.blinkt.openvpn v 0.7.8), Firefox exits after approximately 1 second after launching. When disconnected from the VPN-connection, everything seems to work as intended.
2 Weeks ago everything seemed to work fine, even when connected to same VPN-servers. The corresponding bug in Fenix was fixed in v3.2.0.

Secondly, the fix allows the user the freedom to choose their own goals in terms of email management. With an app that is stable and functional, the user can easily select folders, reply to emails, and perform other actions without any hindrance. This empowerment allows them to prioritize and organize their emails according to their individual preferences and needs.

Additionally, fixing the issue enhances the user's privacy. As the app is no longer crashing and restarting constantly, the user can be assured that their emails and personal information are secure and not compromised. This sense of privacy and control over their own data contributes to the value of self-respect for the user.

In summary, resolving ""Issue X"" directly supports the value item of Independent and its corresponding value of Self Direction for the software user.

The bad news is that they were all random crashes in JITted code that will be very hard to debug without reliable steps to reproduce.
Unfortunately, that's all I have... :/ I tested a bit, and it seems to crash at random positions.
That the crash happens within a minute of using Facebook and almost every time is helpful information.
@pocmo This crash is caused by known JS JIT and GC crashes in the ARM64 version of GeckoView.
We should: Configure Focus builds to only use the 32-bit ARM builds of GeckoView, not ARM64.
Or does it not update them at all since there is no ARM64 Focus 7.0 build available?

We can always reopen it later or file a new issue if we have different steps to reproduce.",Hedonism,Pleasure,By resolving the GeckoView crash; the software users can enjoy a seamless experience while using the Facebook platform; thereby promoting the value of Hedonism.,"Resolving the GeckoView crash directly enhances the value of Hedonism for software users because it allows them to enjoy a smooth and uninterrupted experience while using the Facebook platform. When users encounter the crash, it disrupts their pleasure and enjoyment of the app, causing frustration and annoyance. By fixing the issue, the software users can engage with the app without any interruptions, leading to a pleasurable and satisfying experience.

Hedonism values the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain. The crash in GeckoView causes pain for the software users as it interrupts their browsing experience and hinders their ability to derive pleasure from the app. Therefore, by addressing this issue, developers are directly supporting the value item of Pleasure within the value of Hedonism. They are actively working to eliminate the pain caused by the crash and create a more pleasurable and enjoyable experience for the software users.

Furthermore, a seamless and crash-free experience promotes the value of Hedonism by allowing software users to indulge in their desires and passions without any hindrances. When users can scroll through Facebook without fear of a crash, they can engage with content that brings them pleasure, such as photos, videos, and updates from friends and family. By addressing the GeckoView crash, developers are prioritizing the software users' hedonistic desires and ensuring their pleasure and enjoyment are not compromised. Overall, fixing ""Issue X"" directly contributes to the value of Hedonism by enhancing the software users' pleasure and supporting their pursuit of a pleasurable experience within the software product context.",Agreed-Justified,Agree,,Agree,

I found this out by trying to open the message from the notification area.  When I did, the textsecure password screen came up and when I entered the password, it would pause for several seconds (10-15) and then crash (I did file the reports, but one of those even crashed).  Once I restarted the app, I could enter the password and read the text.  At which point all was clear until I received another unencrypted text and the scenario would repeat itself.  Only when I restarted the phone would the behavior stop and I haven't had it happen since.  Sorry I don't have better initial steps to reproduce.  If this is too hard to track down at all I totally understand but I did want to write this up to go with the crash reports you hopefully did receive.

Conformity refers to adhering to established norms, rules, and standards within a particular social context. In the context of secure communication practices and the use of an encryption app like Textsecure, self-discipline plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of communication and safeguarding sensitive information.

When the app crashes for unencrypted messages, it poses a security risk as the user's private conversations can potentially be accessed by unauthorized individuals. By fixing this issue, the software user is motivated to exercise self-discipline by ensuring that all messages are properly encrypted before being sent or received. This aligns with the value of conformity, as the user is conforming to established norms and standards of secure communication practices.

Furthermore, fixing the issue enhances the software user's sense of control and personal responsibility in protecting their own privacy and the privacy of others.

Nothing in the logs looks concerning. As in, I don't see anything going crazy, or getting stuck. However, it's worth noting that your Signal usage seems to be pretty heavy and consistent over the last 4 hours or so. Higher app usage means higher battery usage. You also made a call, which can use a lot of battery.
4.33.x does include a new version of WebRTC (although it was present in 4.33.2) -- do you see higher battery usage during calls at all? Could be something with the new version.
Other than that, my debugging capabilities are sort of at an end. Haven't seen this reported in any of the other support channels, nor have I seen any issues on my personal device.
In order to learn anymore, I'd need an Android Bug report (Developer Options > Take bug report > Full report) which contains a lot of battery statistics. However, it also contains detailed metrics on how all apps on your phone are used, so I'd recommend you don't post it anywhere publicly. If you're interested in sharing this report with me (no worries if you don't want to), you can DM me on the forum or send it via Signal to one of my test numbers: +1 610-839-7235. Ok, where do I find the file? After you click the button, it kicks of an async process where it's doing stuff invisibly in the background. It'll post a notification when it's done (can take multiple minutes). Click the notification, then share it any number of ways. I think Signal doesn't actually show up as a handler because of our share filter or something, but you can put it any number of places, then send it to me however you like. Ok, so I looked through the battery report, and there appears to be some discrepancies between your experience and what the report says. Here's the summary:
Report covers the last 6 hours
Over that period, you went from 100% to ~60% battery (not fantastic, but not terrible either)
The report says Signal accounts for ~4% of the battery usage
Your screen was on for ~1:18, so a non-trivial amount of time
Your mobile radio was active for ~2:32, also non-trivial
Signal was used pretty heavily
Here's an interesting thing: Signal is listed as being a 'foreground process' for almost the entire 6 hours. However, I looked at your logs, and I can see you use the screen lock. So that makes sense -- we keep a foreground notification to show when Signal is unlocked.
This could result in your device mis-attributing battery usage to Signal, even though the battery report shows Signal didn't consume much energy at all. That's my best guess. I don't see anything crazy in the report.
If this happens again, you're more than welcome to send me another report, and I'll take a look. If you ever want to look at the report yourself in the future, install Docker on your system and run:
docker run -p 9999:9999 gcr.io/android-battery-historian/stable:3.0 --port 9999
Then go to localhost:9999 in your browser, and you'll be greeted with a Web UI that let's you select your bugreport.
(That's assuming Mac or LInux -- Windows instructions are slightly different and can be read about here).

Nothing in the logs looks concerning. As in, I don't see anything going crazy, or getting stuck. However, it's worth noting that your Signal usage seems to be pretty heavy and consistent over the last 4 hours or so. Higher app usage means higher battery usage. You also made a call, which can use a lot of battery.
4.33.x does include a new version of WebRTC (although it was present in 4.33.2) -- do you see higher battery usage during calls at all? Could be something with the new version.
Other than that, my debugging capabilities are sort of at an end. Haven't seen this reported in any of the other support channels, nor have I seen any issues on my personal device.
In order to learn anymore, I'd need an Android Bug report (Developer Options > Take bug report > Full report) which contains a lot of battery statistics. However, it also contains detailed metrics on how all apps on your phone are used, so I'd recommend you don't post it anywhere publicly. If you're interested in sharing this report with me (no worries if you don't want to), you can DM me on the forum or send it via Signal to one of my test numbers: +1 610-839-7235. Ok, where do I find the file? After you click the button, it kicks of an async process where it's doing stuff invisibly in the background. It'll post a notification when it's done (can take multiple minutes). Click the notification, then share it any number of ways. I think Signal doesn't actually show up as a handler because of our share filter or something, but you can put it any number of places, then send it to me however you like. Ok, so I looked through the battery report, and there appears to be some discrepancies between your experience and what the report says. Here's the summary:
Report covers the last 6 hours
Over that period, you went from 100% to ~60% battery (not fantastic, but not terrible either)
The report says Signal accounts for ~4% of the battery usage
Your screen was on for ~1:18, so a non-trivial amount of time
Your mobile radio was active for ~2:32, also non-trivial
Signal was used pretty heavily
Here's an interesting thing: Signal is listed as being a 'foreground process' for almost the entire 6 hours. However, I looked at your logs, and I can see you use the screen lock. So that makes sense -- we keep a foreground notification to show when Signal is unlocked.
This could result in your device mis-attributing battery usage to Signal, even though the battery report shows Signal didn't consume much energy at all. That's my best guess. I don't see anything crazy in the report.
If this happens again, you're more than welcome to send me another report, and I'll take a look. If you ever want to look at the report yourself in the future, install Docker on your system and run:
docker run -p 9999:9999 gcr.io/android-battery-historian/stable:3.0 --port 9999
Then go to localhost:9999 in your browser, and you'll be greeted with a Web UI that let's you select your bugreport.

Password managers play a crucial role in maintaining the security of sensitive information, such as login credentials, for software users. With the compatibility of password managers in the browser, users can securely store their passwords and entrust the task of remembering complex passwords to a reliable tool. By allowing password managers like LastPass and 1Password to integrate seamlessly with the browser, software users can have peace of mind knowing that their family's online accounts and personal data are protected.

The compatibility of password managers also addresses the concern of information leakage to third-party apps without the user's agreement. Without proper integration, password managers may not be able to detect the correct URLs in the browsing session, leading to potential security risks. By fixing this issue, the software ensures that sensitive information is not unintentionally shared with unauthorized parties. This enhances the value of ""Family Security"" as users can trust that their personal information and online activities are safeguarded from potential threats and privacy breaches.

Moreover, supporting password manager compatibility enhances the overall user experience by promoting secure and efficient login processes. Users no longer need to remember multiple passwords or rely on weak and easily guessable passwords. This fosters a sense of family security by minimizing the risk of unauthorized access to accounts and protecting important family-related information, such as financial and personal records. Users can focus on utilizing the software's features without constantly worrying about security vulnerabilities, resulting in a more positive and satisfying user experience.",Agreed-Justified,Disagree,The issue does not mention specifically about family.,Disagree,It is not realated to family security

Remember that some of the privacy-focused (oops) people for that very reason do not use Google Play, and AFAIK you're not on the official F-Droid repo (yet).

If one of your team has an account on GitLab, be welcome to ""chime in"" and confirm you support inclusion. I've just verified with your documentation: as telemetry should be off by default with Klar, all criteria should be met (as I pointed out in the linked issue).

NB: This is a website bug based on the description but we also have Yahoo in the current auto-config stuff so I'm leaving this open here anyway. Additionally, the ""android."" hostname addresses indicated above do not currently exist in DNS, so not possible to use them even if they were documented. What I can say on the matter is that I came to this conclusion after attempting to get my yahoo email connected to the app and it not working with the instructions provided, after working hard on this and making that small change ""andriod"" it worked like a champ. Checking again, ""android.imap.mail.yahoo.com"" and ""android.smtp ..."" are [now] in the DNS. I thought I had tried the (correct) spelling ""android."" last night but it is possible that I only did copy/paste so only used your (incorrect) spelling ""andriod.""
The android.imap. and straight imap. versions point to the same yahoo machines, so it shouldn't matter which you use.
The android.smtp. and smtp. names (currently) point to different IPnumbers, so it is possible that you could get different interactions.
While I found references to the ""android."" names in  yahoo.com user forums, in my quick searching, I only found the versions without the ""android."" on yahoo.com documentation pages.
So, I think that this should work with or without the ""android."", certainly in the case of the ""imap"" entry as with and without ""android."" points to the same yahoo machines. sounds great, love the app and happy I got my yahoo working with it again, I see the spelling error and edited it Correct Information

If an email message in a K9 IMAP account contains attachments, a user should be able to forward the email and its attachments without downloading the attachments.
See also https://code.google.com/archive/p/k9mail/issues/216

The user has two options: forward the email without attachments; or download the attachments before forwarding the email.
Specifically, this requires the implementation of three Lemonade extensions: CATENATE, URLAUTH and BURL.
I believe that Isode's and Oracle's email servers already support the server side of these. Dovecot supports two and is scheduled to support the final one in its next release (2.3; https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/apps-discuss/current/msg13450.html ), which should make this far more ubiquitous.

Social recognition is about gaining approval, respect, and status from others. When a software user is able to control their notification volume and prevent sudden loud notifications in social settings, they are better able to maintain a sense of control over their environment and avoid any potential embarrassment or attention that may arise from disruptive notifications.

Focus + GeckoView from master as of July 16.
When using the mobile Reddit site you are encouraged to install their native app. They do this with a button that links to a custom scheme to open the Reddit app. The custom URL scheme triggers the native app. This works in WebView but not in GeckoView.
Steps to reproduce:
Visit Reddit.com
If they bug you with the big 'View Reddit in the app' banner, just hit the red Continue button
If you don't get the banner, tap the the little blue Use App button in the top bar

Nothing happens. No prompt, no navigation. @ekager to confirm if this also happens with the latest WV version I tried it out with the latest version pulled from master on July 22nd and it was functioning as expected.
When trying to download the reddit app, it opened the play store.
Similarly when trying to open another video calling app from a web page, it was able to open it correctly. Confirmed this works in WV and not in GV. If you copy + paste the custom scheme (for example: reddit://reddit/?link_click_id=550437242878965404) into GV it does work, so we're not getting the url request for these schemes for some reason.

Technically, this page is not using a ""custom scheme"" today as far as I can tell. The scheme is HTTPS. The issue is that https://reddit.app.link should be handled by an IntentFilter of the Reddit app. Since HTTPS is a supported scheme, the logic falls through to shouldOverrideUrlLoading in the super class for WebViewClient, which is this:
https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebViewClient.html#shouldOverrideUrlLoading(android.webkit.WebView,%20android.webkit.WebResourceRequest) Oh, I see.

However Fennec asks Mozilla's GeoIP service to determine the country code. So that I get German search engines / defaults in Germany even with en_US locale. That's something we probably should copy.
Related code:
https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/mobile/android/base/java/org/mozilla/gecko/search/SearchEngineManager.java?q=path%3ASearchEngineManager&redirect_type=single#428 Focus for iOS seems to pick the search engines solely based on the region setting. We do not use this service in Focus for iOS currently. Let's ask @mkaply if he thinks this is a requirement for Focus for Android v1.0 or if we are good with the locale detection that we currently do. The reason Focus for iOS doesn't use the search service is because we never ported any of the search service work over to iOS at all.
If we could use the search services in Focus, that would be helpful so we don't end up with a technical debt there.
The code to query the search service is pretty self contained in https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/mobile/android/base/java/org/mozilla/gecko/search/SearchEngineManager.java. From talking on Slack: Should be implemented - but can be in the next release. I consider this to be an anti-feature (called 'Tracking' in the F-Droid store) because it builds up a connection without the user's consent.
Using the system's locale setting is the right way to determine the country for a privacy-focused app. Why would an en_US user in Germany want to use a German language search engine? If they spoke or preferred German, they could set their device locale to de_DE or manually navigate to a German language search engine like google.de.
What is the behavior of Chrome on Android and Safari on iOS? Using the system's locale setting is the right way to determine the country for a privacy-focused app.
Unfortunately in our testing, 50% of users have en-US set as their locale but are not located in the US. So using the system locale is very unreliable.
The issue here is not the language of the search per say, it's about agreements we have to use a particular search engine (or search code) in a particular region. So we need to know someone is in Ireland so we can give them the Irish eBay, for instance.
Again, locale is completely unreliable. I did not know that the agreements also affect Firefox Focus/Klar and have to be enforced.
Other (no-network) ways of determining the location:
""Choose your country"" dialog
Request coarse/fine location
A choice of a dialog and the network-based locating would be acceptable in my opinion. Otherwise the app implys that the user agreed to ""coarse location"" and considers the use of Mozilla's service safe for their means (including letting the network infrastructure and DNS servers know). I definitely don't want to ask for coarse/fine location because it gives us data we aren't going to use (too fine). ""Choose your country"" dialog

However Fennec asks Mozilla's GeoIP service to determine the country code. So that I get German search engines / defaults in Germany even with en_US locale. That's something we probably should copy.
Related code:
https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/mobile/android/base/java/org/mozilla/gecko/search/SearchEngineManager.java?q=path%3ASearchEngineManager&redirect_type=single#428 Focus for iOS seems to pick the search engines solely based on the region setting. We do not use this service in Focus for iOS currently. Let's ask @mkaply if he thinks this is a requirement for Focus for Android v1.0 or if we are good with the locale detection that we currently do. The reason Focus for iOS doesn't use the search service is because we never ported any of the search service work over to iOS at all.
If we could use the search services in Focus, that would be helpful so we don't end up with a technical debt there.
The code to query the search service is pretty self contained in https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/mobile/android/base/java/org/mozilla/gecko/search/SearchEngineManager.java. From talking on Slack: Should be implemented - but can be in the next release. I consider this to be an anti-feature (called 'Tracking' in the F-Droid store) because it builds up a connection without the user's consent.
Using the system's locale setting is the right way to determine the country for a privacy-focused app. Why would an en_US user in Germany want to use a German language search engine? If they spoke or preferred German, they could set their device locale to de_DE or manually navigate to a German language search engine like google.de.
What is the behavior of Chrome on Android and Safari on iOS? Using the system's locale setting is the right way to determine the country for a privacy-focused app.
Unfortunately in our testing, 50% of users have en-US set as their locale but are not located in the US. So using the system locale is very unreliable.
The issue here is not the language of the search per say, it's about agreements we have to use a particular search engine (or search code) in a particular region. So we need to know someone is in Ireland so we can give them the Irish eBay, for instance.
Again, locale is completely unreliable. I did not know that the agreements also affect Firefox Focus/Klar and have to be enforced.
Other (no-network) ways of determining the location:
""Choose your country"" dialog
Request coarse/fine location
A choice of a dialog and the network-based locating would be acceptable in my opinion. Otherwise the app implys that the user agreed to ""coarse location"" and considers the use of Mozilla's service safe for their means (including letting the network infrastructure and DNS servers know). I definitely don't want to ask for coarse/fine location because it gives us data we aren't going to use (too fine). ""Choose your country"" dialog

I'm unsure at this point about the schedule for v7 - but seems like there is still time for testing against screenshots. @npark-mozilla: Would that be possible on your side?
If it is, let's leave these locales under screenshots only in locales.py, and we can move them to release once localizers have been able to check against all the screens thanks to screenshots.
@Sdaswani: Just want to check, what's the ideal date to get in all new locales for v7 release? @Delphine though we are in beta now we aren't releasing 7.0 until mid-September - so you think getting them in by September 1st is doable? and thanks in advance! cc @boek for his FYI.

The CHUNKING extension (RFC 3030) allows for a BDAT command to replace the DATA command. This allows for messages to be sent as continual chunks of data rather than line-wrapped.
It is supported by Gmail and other providers.
Implementation of this will need to be aware of the PIPELINE extension (see #2338) and  8BITMIME extension.
We will need to pick an appropriate chunk size. This might involve investigation of what other providers use (the RFC uses 100000 but it's unclear whether this figure was arbitrarily chosen). It seems over-the-top to allow it to be configurable.
Obviously if the extension instead present we will need to use the normal data command.
Tests should cover use and lack of the extension, as well interaction with PIPELINING What do you mean by ""often slow due to the need to line-wrap content""? What exactly should be different when sending the message in chunks?
BINARYMIME + BDAT allows sending 8-bit parts, e.g. attachments without base64 encoding. However, I don't know of any clients that actually do this. I'm not even sure if we support receiving such messages. Hmm odd.
The RFC is kind of annoying in that they are both specified in one RFC and the pre-amble makes statements  where it's unclear whether you need both for the benefit.
Gmail advertises CHUNKING without BINARYMIME and reading the RFC I assumed CHUNKING got rid of all CRLF stuff.
But it actually looks like it's mostly an efficiency to avoid the ending:

This more efficient method of sending messages adds excitement to the user experience by enabling smoother communication. Users will no longer have to wait for line-wrapped messages to be sent, resulting in faster and more efficient message delivery.

Furthermore, this improvement also aligns with the value of Stimulation, as it introduces a new feature that enhances the functionality of the software product.

Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP (dovecot, self-hosted, other clients work) I'm wondering whether this is related to IMAP's delete-purge interaction. Not sure without device logs. Please provide a debug log: https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/wiki/LoggingErrors I have seen similar behavior that is possibly the same bug.  If I delete an e-mail on the server, push notification does not pick up on it, but if manually refresh (Or whatever the name is for the arrows in a circle icon), the message disappears on k-9.  I confirmed that dovecot sends an EXPUNGE message out.  I'll record a debug log in k-9 next. I see nothing logged for k9 trying the instructions on https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/wiki/LoggingErrors Note I also see nothing logged when I get a new push message either though (and that part works for me). Just to make sure I'm dumping the right buffer, the lines I do see are of the form:
W/IInputConnectionWrapper( 4291 ): getTextAfterCursor on inactive InputConnection Nevermind, just saw ""The app WON'T work with Android 4.1 and newer."" which is probably why I'm not seeing anything.  I don't have a micro-usb cable handy so will have to wait until later. @Nergal-di-Cuthah I mean aLogcat; I don't have a micro-usb cable handy so was trying to use that to dump the logs. Yeah, I realized that when I clicked the logging errors link all the way through, what about using ""logcat extreme"" or ""matlog"" Log attached, showing EXPUNGE message:
k9-log2.txt I have the same issue, when I remove the message I still can see it in webmail until I press expunge.

When users delete emails, they expect them to be permanently removed and not visible to anyone else who may have access to their device. However, when ""Issue X"" occurs, deleted emails reappear upon checking the inbox again. This can lead to potential breaches of family security, as any sensitive or confidential information contained within these emails could now be accessible to others.

Either way, this is a k-9 problem, not OpenKeychain :) I'm fairly sure I ran into another instance of this bug: encrypted Facebook notifications.
If you have NOT activated cryptography on your account and get such a message, the message will appear blank and won't give you a chance to do anything with it. There will be a 69B noname.pgp attachment that can't be decrypted even when you have the right private key in OpenKeychain.
The same message, when viewed in webmail, shows a blank message with two attachments, one of which is encrypted.asc with a size >5MB, so the 69B .pgp file is a ghost rather than a compression miracle
This should give you an easy way to replicate the bug: make a new email address, get a PGP key and a Facebook account on it, try to add notifications.

Would it be feasible to add a setting for this? Those are not standard headers and not something that is added by a mail client. SMTP servers often add these. Maybe I did not get the correct name of the field, and it's just the way other clients name it in the settings. But last time I discussed this in a k9 mail forum, I was told this is from RFC 821, so that would make it a standard header. From your description it's not clear to me what the actual problem is. If you have something concrete to point to, please do. Some servers I use won't accept arbitrary addresses in the message From: field unless the Envelope-From is set to an address that belongs to the same server. I don't believe a mail client for end users should use a sender address in the SMTP session that's different from the one in the actual message. I haven't seen this supported by any other client either. I have been able to do this with different clients on a desktop computer. Still, regardless of whether other clients support it or not, it would be convenient for me if k9 mail had this feature. Otherwise I have to get a different mail server just to use k9 mail as a main mail client.",Security,Reciprocation of Favors,Fixing the Envelope-From setting discussed in the Issue allows users to set a specific Envelope-From address that belongs to the same server as the message From: field; enhancing the reciprocation of favors and creating a sense of trust with SMTP servers.,"Fixing the Envelope-From setting discussed in the Issue directly contributes to the value item of Reciprocation of Favors as users are able to set a specific Envelope-From address that belongs to the same server as the message From: field.

As you may know BlackBerry is a popular choice for mobile phones sending PGP email. However K-9 Mail seems unable to decrypt the email from many BlackBerry devices. K-9 Mail can process the email but doesn't detect it as a PGP-encrypted message and simply shows an 'unencrypted' email with the body being a base64-encoded string.

Cheers,
Kelaghn Thanks for the detailed bug report! I'll look into it Hey Valodim,
This appears to be happening on non-BlackBerry emails as well, basically any non-multipart emails using base64 as the content-transfer-encoding show up as a block of base64 text.
I've included another example that won't decode:

PCFET0N[.. truncated for brevity ...]
I tried to fix this myself but was a little confused where the relevant code to change was, The various body and part subclasses were a little confusing. I believe a fix may be applied in LocalStore.java to check for the encoding. Functions to decode base64 already exist however they're not being applied to actually decode emails like this. Only multipart messages seem to get their base64 decoded (for attachments) although I can't confirm that's working. Possibly same as #2479? Not the same issue at all. No encryption error is being shown, K9 simply fails to decode the message at all and renders it as a block of base64 text I looked into the code, and I do think that base64 encoded pgp/inline should work.
I tested your case as follows: I took a pgp/inline mail with content-type text/plain, added a Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64 header, and base64 encoded the body. This was decrypted correctly. I then replaced the entire header with the one you pasted here (leaving the b64 body untouched), and that too, worked. I noticed there is an extra newline at the beginning of the b64 encoded data you pasted above, so I added that and it still decrypted correctly.
There must be something going on in the base64 encoded body, or something else entirely. Can you send a full email like this to me? Either write a new one in the affected way, or just forward including the b64 (I won't be able to decrypt it, obviously :) )

This is because by resolving the problem of K-9 Mail's inability to decrypt PGP emails from BlackBerry devices, users can effectively assist and support their correspondents who rely on BlackBerry phones to send encrypted messages. Encryption is an essential aspect of ensuring secure communication, especially for individuals who prioritize privacy and confidentiality in their online interactions. By being able to properly detect and display PGP-encrypted messages, K-9 Mail empowers users to actively help their contacts achieve their communication and security goals.

Furthermore, enabling the decryption of PGP emails from BlackBerry devices enhances users' ability to actively engage in secure and private communication. When users can read and respond to encrypted messages, they can effectively participate in important discussions, collaborate on sensitive projects, and provide valuable feedback or assistance to others. This level of support and active involvement strengthens interpersonal relationships and fosters a sense of benevolence (v9.3) and responsibility (v9.8) in users. By ensuring that communication barriers are removed and that users can actively engage in secure communication, the fix directly aligns with the value item of being helpful and the overall value of benevolence in Schwartz's Taxonomy.

Moreover, fixing ""Issue X"" also enhances the user experience by improving the efficiency and usability of K-9 Mail. When users no longer have to manually decode base64-encoded strings to access PGP-encrypted messages, it saves them time and effort in their daily use of the app. This increased efficiency allows users to focus on the content and context of the messages they receive, rather than being burdened by complex technical processes.

In email exchanges, it is important for the sender address in the SMTP session to align with the one in the actual message. This alignment promotes honesty and integrity, as it ensures that the recipient knows the true identity of the sender and can trust the authenticity of the message.

By allowing users to set a value for Envelope-From, the software product enables them to accurately represent themselves in the email communication.

If I delete an e-mail on the server, push notification does not pick up on it, but if manually refresh (Or whatever the name is for the arrows in a circle icon), the message disappears on k-9.

Just to make sure I'm dumping the right buffer, the lines I do see are of the form:

They can delete unwanted or irrelevant emails and keep their inbox organized and clutter-free; enhancing their overall email experience.","By fixing ""Issue X"" and preventing deleted emails from reappearing, the value item of cleanliness (v6.4) in the email inbox is directly supported. For software users, a clean and organized inbox is essential for efficient email management and productivity. When unwanted or irrelevant emails reappear after being deleted, it creates clutter and disrupts the user experience.

Having a clutter-free inbox not only enhances the overall email experience, but it also contributes to a sense of order and control for software users.

Cheers,
Kelaghn Thanks for the detailed bug report! I'll look into it Hey Valodim,
This appears to be happening on non-BlackBerry emails as well, basically any non-multipart emails using base64 as the content-transfer-encoding show up as a block of base64 text.
I've included another example that won't decode:
MIME-Version: 1.0

To: recipient@recipient.com

Subject: Example subject
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
PCFET0N[.. truncated for brevity ...]
I tried to fix this myself but was a little confused where the relevant code to change was, The various body and part subclasses were a little confusing. I believe a fix may be applied in LocalStore.java to check for the encoding. Functions to decode base64 already exist however they're not being applied to actually decode emails like this. Only multipart messages seem to get their base64 decoded (for attachments) although I can't confirm that's working. Possibly same as #2479? Not the same issue at all. No encryption error is being shown, K9 simply fails to decode the message at all and renders it as a block of base64 text I looked into the code, and I do think that base64 encoded pgp/inline should work.
I tested your case as follows: I took a pgp/inline mail with content-type text/plain, added a Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64 header, and base64 encoded the body. This was decrypted correctly. I then replaced the entire header with the one you pasted here (leaving the b64 body untouched), and that too, worked. I noticed there is an extra newline at the beginning of the b64 encoded data you pasted above, so I added that and it still decrypted correctly.
There must be something going on in the base64 encoded body, or something else entirely. Can you send a full email like this to me? Either write a new one in the affected way, or just forward including the b64 (I won't be able to decrypt it, obviously :) )

I tried to fix this myself but was a little confused where the relevant code to change was, The various body and part subclasses were a little confusing.

No encryption error is being shown, K9 simply fails to decode the message at all and renders it as a block of base64 text I looked into the code, and I do think that base64 encoded pgp/inline should work.
I tested your case as follows: I took a pgp/inline mail with content-type text/plain, added a Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64 header, and base64 encoded the body. This was decrypted correctly. I then replaced the entire header with the one you pasted here (leaving the b64 body untouched), and that too, worked. I noticed there is an extra newline at the beginning of the b64 encoded data you pasted above, so I added that and it still decrypted correctly.
There must be something going on in the base64 encoded body, or something else entirely. Can you send a full email like this to me? Either write a new one in the affected way, or just forward including the b64 (I won't be able to decrypt it, obviously :) )

As you may know BlackBerry is a popular choice for mobile phones sending PGP email. However K-9 Mail seems unable to decrypt the email from many BlackBerry devices.

k9 should use the SMTP server of the associated account.
Actual behavior
k9 uses the SMTP server of a different account.
Steps to reproduce
Unfortunately I'm not exactly sure how to reproduce this.
I have multiple accounts configured in k9. For the sake of simplicity let's assume these are default@example.com and other@example.net. I composed a new mail and changed the sender from my default account to the other one at the top, wrote the body and pressed send. The sender address was now correctly set to my other account but k9 tried to deliver it using my default account's SMTP server. The mail couldn't be send.
I was able to grab logcat output when the mail was attempted to be re-sent.
Naturally, the SMTP server rejected a mail that's not coming from the associated sender address:
Negative SMTP reply: 553 5.7.1 <other@example.net>: Sender address rejected: not owned by user default@example.com

Environment
K-9 Mail version: 5.010
Android version: 6.0.1, Cyanogenmod 13.0
Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange):
Both involved accounts use IMAP and SMTP. I'm seeing the same behavior with K-9 version 5.206 under Android 4.4.4 (Samsung/TMobile stock).
If I reach a message from the Universal Inbox, start a reply and then change the selected identity during composition, the message, when sent or saved, is sent to the server associated with the original identity but with the address from the chosen identity.
This is always the wrong choice.  Mail is either rewritten by the server on the way through to reflect an identity I didn't choose (gmail's behavior) or passed through intact and then thrown away by the receiver for having come from a rogue mailhost. An example, step by step.
In my contacts list I have some email addresses which allow email-to-sms to work through Google Voice. I chose one of those from the contact list today, changed the sender to match the Google account connected with the GV account, composed and sent the messsge.
K9 submitted the message using the wrong credentials and Google replied with a bounce messsge to the wrong Google user telling me the recipient did not exist.
Address not found
Your message wasn't delivered to 1aaapppxxxx.1aaapppxxxx.CnQ7ZbSDkr@txt.voice.google.com because the address couldn't be found. Check for typos or unnecessary spaces and try again.
(phone numbers obscured.)
The same action sequence has worked in the past.  The problem is k9 not fully respecting the change of identity. In the example cited above, further digging reveals k9 used the wrong credentials.  The message was sent with the name from the selected identity but the credentials from the default identity.  Both identities in this case were configured to use the same server.
The mismatched names appear on the From: line of the copy automatically dropped into Google's ""Gmail/Sent Mail"" folder in, of course, the wrong account.
Saving a message as a draft before sending it usually solves this... but not always: sometimes the message is saved to the Drafts folder of the wrong account.
Saving a message as a draft before sending is generally a good idea on k9.  Unrelated to this bug I've found plenty of cases where messages are discarded if send is pressed before save.  That happens most when k9 is launched from the sharing menu on Gallery or hiq-mp3 recorder.

Actual behavior
see description above
Environment
K-9 Mail version: 5.403
Android version:
7.1.1
Account type = IMAP You shouldn't have to manually trust letsencrypt certificates. Maybe the certificate does not include the email server's hostname? Can you post a screenshot of the dialog K-9 Mail displays to accept untrusted certificates? @cketti: I think you are right that it has to do with the hostname.
If I accept the certificate it works well for 90 days until it gets renewed.
My server runs ubuntu 16 and plesk and I have added the certificates using the plesk GUI. Once we add support for RFC 6186 we'll automatically accept a certificate that was issued for the email domain but not the email server's hostname. For now you'll have to add pop.mandango.de to the certificate.",Achievement,Successful,"Fixing ""Issue X"" supports the value item of Successful in the Achievement value. By streamlining the certificate acceptance process and reducing the number of required clicks; users can accomplish the task more efficiently; saving time and effort. This promotes a sense of success and achievement in effectively managing their email server settings.","Fixing ""Issue X"" directly supports the value item of Successful in the Achievement value.

This improved user experience promotes a sense of success and achievement in effectively managing their email server settings.

Firstly, by implementing an exception feature or truncating the clicking process to just a few clicks, users will no longer have to navigate through buried sub-menus and repeat the certificate acceptance process every 90 days. This reduction in effort and time required to perform the task enhances the user's sense of achievement. Users will be able to easily and quickly trust the renewed certificates, allowing them to continue using their mail server without interruption. This seamless and hassle-free experience contributes to users feeling capable and successful in managing their software settings.

Furthermore, the proposed solution emphasizes the importance of creating a user-friendly and efficient software product. Simplifying the certificate acceptance process aligns with the value item of Intelligent, as it demonstrates the ability to design a system that understands the user's needs and automates repetitive tasks.
