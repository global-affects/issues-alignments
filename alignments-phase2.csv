Firstly, it ensures that only active and interested members remain in the group, eliminating the presence of stale or disengaged individuals. This creates a more cohesive and engaged community within the group, where members can connect with like-minded individuals who are genuinely interested in the group's topic or purpose. By removing users who have unsubscribed, the group becomes more focused and aligned, which enhances the feeling of belonging for the remaining members.

Additionally, by automatically removing unsubscribed users, software users feel a greater level of security within the group. Knowing that only active users are part of the group reduces the risk of unwanted or irrelevant interactions. This improves the overall user experience and fosters a sense of trust and safety within the group. Software users can freely express themselves, share experiences, and seek support or information from other group members without the concern of dealing with individuals who are no longer engaged or involved.

Furthermore, automatic removal of unsubscribed users addresses the issue of privacy within the group. If a user unsubscribes, they may have chosen to disengage for personal reasons or might have lost access to the number associated with their subscription. By removing these users, privacy is maintained for both the unsubscribed individuals and the remaining members of the group. Users can participate in discussions and share personal experiences knowing that the information shared is within a trusted and active community.

In summary, fixing ""Issue X"" by removing unsubscribed users from groups enhances the sense of belonging and security for software users.
